Matrix multiplication is associative. The identity matrix $I$ has determinant one, and thus belongs to $G$. Finally if $A \\in G$ then $A$ is invertible, with $\\left|A^{-1}\\right|=1 /|A| \\neq 0$, and thus $G$ is closed to inverses. This proves that $G$ is a multiplicative group.\n\n2.

If $A$ commutes with $B$ and with $C$ then $c=0$, $a=d, b=0$ and $A=a I$ is a scalar matrix. On the other hand any scalar matrix commutes with every element of $G$. We conclude that the center of $G$ is the set of all real $2 \\times 2$ matrices $a I$ with $a \\neq 0$.\n\n3. If $A, B$ are orthogonal then $(A B)(A B)^{t}=A B B^{t} A^{t}=I$, so $O$ is closed under multiplication. The identity matrix is orthogonal. Finally, if $A$ is orthogonal then $A^{-1}=A^{t}$ and $A^{-1}\\left(A^{-1}\\right)^{t}=A^{t} A=I$, thus $O$ is a subgroup of $G$.

        "Solution": " For any set $S$ of primes, let $R_{S}$ be the set of rational numbers of the form $a / b$ where $a, b$ are integers and $b$ is a product of powers of primes in $S$. It is clear that $R_{S}$ contains 0 and 1 , and is closed under addition, multiplication, and additive inverses. Hence $R_{S}$ is a subring. If $S$ and $T$ are distinct sets of primes, say with $p \\in S \\backslash T$, then $1 / p \\in R_{S}$ but $1 / p \\notin R_{T}$, so $R_{S} \\neq R_{T}$. Since there are infinitely many primes, we obtain at least $2^{\\aleph_{0}}$ subrings in this way.

Then, by a similar argument, $\\mathfrak{J}=\\mathfrak{I}_{3}$.\n\n- I contains a matrix of the form $\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}a & 0 \\\\ 0 & c\\end{array}\\right)$ with $a \\neq 0 \\neq c$. Since\n\n$$\n\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}\na & 0 \\\\\n0 & c\n\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}\na & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right),\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}\na & 0 \\\\\n0 & c\n\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & c\n\\end{array}\\right),\n$$\n\nwe conclude in this case that $\\mathfrak{I}$ contains both $\\mathfrak{I}_{2}$ and $\\mathfrak{I}_{3}$, hence that $\\mathfrak{I}=A$.\n\nSolution to 6.10.2: Assume that $\\mathfrak{I}$ is a nontrivial ideal. Let $M_{i j}$ be the $n \\times n$ matrix with 1 in the $(i, j)^{\\ell h}$ position and zeros elsewhere. Choose $A \\in \\mathfrak{I}$ such that $a=a_{i j} \\neq 0$. Then, for $1 \\leqslant k \\leqslant n, M_{k i} A M_{j k}$ is a matrix which has $a$ in the $(k, k)^{t h}$ entry and 0 elsewhere. Since $\\mathfrak{I}$ is an ideal, $M_{k i} A M_{j k} \\in \\mathfrak{I}$. The sum of these matrices is $a I$ and so this matrix is also in $\\mathfrak{J}$. However, since $F$ is a field, $a$ is invertible, so $\\mathfrak{I}=M_{n}(\\mathbf{F})$. Solution to 6.10.3: We have see in the Solution to Problem 6.10.2 that $M_{n \\times n}(F)$ has no nontrivial proper ideals. $M_{n \\times n}(\\mathbf{F})$ is an $\\mathbf{F}$-vector field, and if we identify $\\mathbf{F}$ with $\\{a \\mathfrak{I} \\mid a \\in \\mathbf{F}\\}$, we see that any ring homomorphism induces a vector space homomorphism. Hence, if $M_{n \\times n}(F)$ and $M_{(n+1) \\times(n+1)}(F)$ are isomorphic as rings, they are isomorphic as vector spaces. However, they have different dimensions $n^{2}$ and $(n+1)^{2}$, respectively, so this is impossible.\n\nSolution to 6.10.4: Since the kernel of $h$ is a two sided ideal in $R$, it suffices to show that every ideal $\\mathfrak{J}$ in $R$ is either trivial ( $h$ is injective) or all of $R$ ( $h$ is zero).\n\nAssume $\\mathfrak{J}$ is a non-trivial two sided ideal in $R$. Suppose $A \\in \\mathfrak{J}$ with $a_{i j} \\neq 0$ for some $0 \\leqslant i, j \\leqslant n$. If we multiply $A$ on the left by the elementary matrix $E_{j i}$ we get the matrix $B=E_{j i} A$ which has only one nonzero entry $\\left(b_{i j}=a_{i j}\\right)$. If we multiply $B$ on the left by $\\left(1 / a_{i j}\\right) I$, we get $E_{i j}$, therefore $E_{i j} \\in \\mathfrak{J}$. Multiplying $E_{i j}$ on the left and on the right by elementary matrices, we produce all elementary matrices, so these are in $\\mathfrak{J}$. As they generate $R$ we have $\\mathfrak{J}=R$.\n\nSolution to 6.10.5: Each element of $F$ induces a constant function on $X$, and we identify the function with the element of $\\mathbf{F}$. In particular, the function 1 is the unit element in $R(X, \\mathrm{~F})$.\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{I}$ be a proper ideal of $R(X, \\mathbb{F})$. We will prove that there is a nonempty subset $Y$ of $X$ such that $\\mathfrak{I}=\\{f \\in R(X, F) \\mid f(x)=0$ for all $x \\in Y\\}=\\mathfrak{I}_{Y}$. Suppose not. Then either $\\mathfrak{I} \\subset \\mathfrak{I}_{Y}$ for some set $Y$ or, for every point $x \\in X$, there is a function $f_{x}$ in $\\mathfrak{I}$ such that $f_{x}(x)=a \\neq 0$. In the latter case, since $\\mathfrak{I}$ is an ideal and $F$ is a field, we can replace $f_{x}$ by the function $a^{-1} f_{x}$, so we may assume that $f_{x}(x)=1$. Multiplying $f_{x}$ by the function $g_{x}$, which maps $x$ to 1 and all other points of $X$ to 0 , we see that $\\mathfrak{I}$ contains $g_{x}$ for all points $x \\in X$. But then, since $X$ is finite, $\\mathfrak{I}$ contains $\\sum g_{x} \\equiv 1$, which implies that $\\mathfrak{I}$ is not a proper ideal.\n\nHence, there is a nonempty set $Y$ such that $\\mathfrak{I} \\subset \\mathfrak{I}_{Y}$. Let $Y$ be the largest such set. As for every $x \\notin Y$, there is an $f_{x} \\in \\mathfrak{I}$ such that $f_{x}(x) \\neq 0$ (otherwise we would have $\\mathfrak{I} \\subset \\mathfrak{I}_{Y \\cup\\{x\\}}$ ) by an argument similar to the above, $\\mathfrak{I}$ contains all the functions $g_{x}, x \\notin Y$. But, from these, we can construct any function in $\\mathfrak{I}_{Y}$, so $\\mathfrak{I}_{Y} \\subset \\mathfrak{J}$.\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{I}$ and $\\mathfrak{J}$ be two ideals, and the associated sets be $Y$ and $Z$. Then $\\mathfrak{I} \\subset \\mathfrak{J}$ if and only if $Z \\subset Y$. Therefore, an ideal is maximal if and only if its associated set is as small as possible without being empty. Hence, the maximal ideals are precisely those ideals consisting of functions which vanish at one point of $X$.\n\nSolution to 6.10.6: If $f, g \\in E(U, W)$ then so is the homomorphism $f+g$ since its image on $U$ is contained in $f U+g U$. If $Y$ is a subspace and $h \\in E(W, Y)$, then $h \\circ f \\in E(U, Y)$ since $f U \\subseteq W+X$ for some finite dimensional subspace $X$ and $h(f(U)) \\subseteq h(W)+h(X)$. Thus $E(W, Y) E(U, W) \\subseteq E(U, Y)$. From this we see that $E(U, U)$ is a ring with left ideal $E(V, U)$ and right ideal $E(U, 0)$. Also, $E(U, U) \\subseteq E(V, V)=E(0,0)$ so these latter two sets are also right and left ideals. The conclusion follows. Solution to 6.10.7: Let $\\mathfrak{I}=\\left\\langle a^{n}-1, a^{m}-1\\right\\rangle$ and $\\mathfrak{J}=\\left\\langle a^{d}-1\\right\\rangle$. For $n=r d$ the polynomial $x^{n}-1$ factors into $\\left(x^{d}-1\\right)\\left(x^{r(d-1)}+x^{r(d-2)}+\\cdots+x^{r}+1\\right)$. Therefore, in $R, a^{n}-1=\\left(a^{d}-1\\right)\\left(a^{r(d-1)}+a^{r(d-2)}+\\cdots+a^{r}+1\\right)$. A similar identity holds for $a^{m}-1$. Hence, the two generators of $\\mathfrak{I}$ are in $\\mathfrak{J}$, so $\\mathfrak{I} \\subset \\mathfrak{J}$.\n\nSince $d=\\operatorname{gcd}\\{n, m\\}$, there exist positive integers $x, y$ such that $x n-y m=d$. A calculation gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na^{d}-1=& a^{d}-1-a^{d+y m}+a^{x n} \\\\\n=&-a^{d}\\left(a^{y m}-1\\right)+a^{x n}-1 \\\\\n=&-a^{d}\\left(a^{m}-1\\right)\\left(a^{y(m-1)}+\\cdots+a^{y}+1\\right) \\\\\n&+\\left(a^{n}-1\\right)\\left(a^{x(n-1)}+\\cdots+a^{x}+1\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence, $a^{d}-1$ is in $\\mathfrak{J}$, so $\\mathfrak{J} \\subset \\mathfrak{I}$ and the two ideals are equal.\n\nSolution to 6.10.8: 1. If there is an ideal $\\mathfrak{I} \\neq R$ of index, at most, 4, then there is also a maximal ideal of index, at most, $4, \\mathfrak{M}$, say. Then $R / \\mathfrak{M}$ is a field of cardinality less than 5 containing an element $\\alpha$ with $\\alpha^{3}=\\alpha+1$, namely $\\alpha=a+\\mathfrak{M}$. By direct inspection, we see that none of the fields $\\mathbf{F}_{2}, \\mathbf{F}_{3}, \\mathbf{F}_{4}$ contains such an element. Therefore, $\\mathfrak{I}=R$.\n\n2. Let $R=\\mathbb{Z}_{5}, a=2(\\bmod 5)$, and $\\mathfrak{I}=\\{0\\}$.\n\n",

By the least upper bound property, we know that $y_{k}$ exists and is in $[a, b]$ for all $k$. By the definition of supremum, it is clear that the $y_{k}$ 's form a nonincreasing sequence. Let $y$ be the infimum of this sequence. From the definition of infimum, we know that the $y_{k}$ 's converge to $y$. Again, by the definition of supremum, we know that we can find $x_{n}$ 's arbitrarily close to each $y_{k}$, so we can choose a subsequence of the original sequence which converges to $y$.\n\nLemma 2: A continuous function $f$ on $[a, b]$ is bounded.\n\nSuppose $f$ is not bounded. Then, for each $n$, there is a point $x_{n} \\in[a, b]$ such that $\\left|f\\left(x_{n}\\right)\\right|>n$. By passing to a subsequence, we may assume that the $x_{n}$ 's converge to a point $x \\in[a, b]$. (This is possible by Lemma 1.) Then, by the continuity of $f$ at $x$, we must have that $\\left|f(x)-f\\left(x_{n}\\right)\\right|<1$ for $n$ sufficiently large, or $\\left|f\\left(x_{n}\\right)\\right|<|f(x)|+1$, contradicting our choice of the $x_{n}$ 's.\n\nLemma 3: A continuous function $f$ on $[a, b]$ achieves its extrema.\n\nIt will suffice to show that $f$ attains its maximum, the other case is proved in exactly the same way. Let $M=\\sup f$ and suppose $f$ never attains this value. Define $g(x)=M-f(x)$. Then $g(x)>0$ on $[a, b]$, so $1 / g$ is continuous. Therefore, by Lemma $2,1 / g$ is bounded by, say, $N$. Hence, $M-f(x)>1 / N$, or $f(x)<M-1 / N$, contradicting the definition of $M$.\n\nLemma 4: If a differentiable function $f$ on $(a, b)$ has a relative extremum at $a$ point $c \\in(a, b)$, then $f^{\\prime}(c)=0$.\n\nDefine the function $g$ by\n\n$$\ng(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c} & \\text { for } \\quad x \\neq c \\\\\n0 & \\text { for } \\quad x=c\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nand suppose $g(c)>0$. By continuity, we can find an interval $J$ around $c$ such that $g(x)>0$ if $x \\in J$. Therefore, $f(x)-f(c)$ and $x-c$ always have the same sign in $J$, so $f(x)<c$ if $x<c$ and $f(x)>f(c)$ if $x>c$. This contradicts the fact that $f$ has a relative extremum at $c$. A similar argument shows that the assumption that $g(c)<0$ yields a contradiction, so we must have that $g(c)=0$.\n\nLemma 5 (Rolle's Theorem [MH93, p. 200]): Let $f$ be continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$ with $f(a)=f(b)$. There is a point $c \\in(a, b)$ such that $f^{\\prime}(c)=0$. Suppose $f^{\\prime}(c) \\neq 0$ for all $c \\in(a, b)$. By Lemma $3, f$ attains its extrema on $[a, b]$, but by Lemma 4 it cannot do so in the interior since otherwise the derivative at that point would be zero. Hence, it attains its maximum and minimum at the endpoints. Since $f(a)=f(b)$, it follows that $f$ is constant, and so $f^{\\prime}(c)=0$ for all $c \\in(a, b)$, a contradiction.\n\nLemma 6 (Mean Value Theorem [Rud87, p. 108]): If $f$ is a continuous function on $[a, b]$, differentiable on $(a, b)$, then there is $c \\in(a, b)$ such that $f(b)-f(a)=f^{\\prime}(c)(b-a)$.\n\nDefine the function $h(x)=f(x)(b-a)-x(f(b)-f(a)) . h$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, differentiable on $(a, b)$, and $h(a)=h(b)$.

        "Problem Statement": " Let $k$ be a positive integer. Determine those real numbers c for which every sequence $\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ of real numbers satisfying the recurrence relation\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x_{n+1}+x_{n-1}\\right)=c x_{n}\n$$\n\nhas period $k$ (i.e., $x_{n+k}=x_{n}$ for all $n$ ).\n\n",
        "Solution": " The given relation can be written in matrix form as $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}x_{n+1} \\\\ x_{n}\\end{array}\\right)=$ $A\\left(\\begin{array}{c}x_{n-1} \\\\ x_{n}\\end{array}\\right)$, where $A=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}2 c & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{array}\\right)$. The required periodicity holds if and only if $A^{k}=$ $\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right)$. The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $\\lambda^{2}-2 c \\lambda+1$, so the eigenvalues of $A$ are $c \\pm \\sqrt{c^{2}-1}$. A necessary condition for $A^{k}=\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right)$ is that the eigenvalues of $A$ be $k^{t h}$ roots of unity, which implies that $c=\\cos \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi j}{k}\\right), j=0,1, \\ldots,\\left\\lfloor\\frac{k}{2}\\right\\rfloor$. If $c$ has the preceding form and $0<j<\\frac{k}{2}$ (i.e., $-1<c<1$ ), then the eigenvalues of $A$ are distinct (i.e., $A$ is diagonalizable), and the equality $A^{k}=\\left(\\begin{array}{l}1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right)$ holds. If $c=1$ or $-1$, then the eigenvalues of $A$ are not distinct, and $A$ has the Jordan Canonical Form [HK61, p. 247]\n\n$\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right)$ or $\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}-1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{array}\\right)$, respectively, in which case $A^{k} \\neq\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right)$. Hence, the desired periodicity holds if and only if $c=\\cos \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi j}{k}\\right)$, where $j$ is an integer, and $0<j<$ $k / 2$\n\n",
