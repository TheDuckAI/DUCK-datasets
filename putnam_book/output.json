        "Solution": "\n64. We call a number good if it satisfies the given condition. It is not difficult to see that all powers of primes are good. Suppose $n$ is a good number that has at least two distinct prime factors. Let $n=p^{r} s$, where $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $n$ and $s$ is not divisible by $p$. Because $n$ is good, $p+s-1$ must divide $n$. For any prime $q$ dividing $s, s<p+s-1<s+q$, so $q$ does not divide $p+s-1$. Therefore, the only prime factor of $p+s-1$ is $p$. Then $s=p^{c}-p+1$ for some integer $c>1$. Because $p^{c}$ must also divide $n, p^{c}+s-1=2 p^{c}-p$ divides $n$. Because $2 p^{c-1}-1$ has no factors of $p$, it must divide $s$.

        "Solution": "\n237. It is obvious that $\\operatorname{gcd}(x, x+y)=\\operatorname{gcd}(x, x+z)=1$. So in the equality from the statement, $x$ divides $y+z$. Similarly, $y$ divides $z+x$ and $z$ divides $x+y$. It follows that there exist integers $a, b, c$ with $a b c=t$ and$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&x+y=c z, \\\\\n&y+z=a x,\n\\end{aligned}\n$$$$\nz+x=b y .\n$$View this as a homogeneous system in the variables $x, y, z$. Because we assume that the system admits nonzero solutions, the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero. Writing down this fact, we obtain a new Diophantine equation in the unknowns $a, b, c$ :$$\na b c-a-b-c-2=0 .\n$$This can be solved by examining the following cases:1. $a=b=c$. Then $a=2$ and it follows that $x=y=z$, because these numbers are pairwise coprime. This means that $x=y=z=1$ and $t=8$. We have obtained the solution $(1,1,1,8)$.2. $a=b, a \\neq c$. The equation becomes $a^{2} c-2=2 a+c$, which is equivalent to $c\\left(a^{2}-1\\right)=2(a+1)$, that is, $c(a-1)=2$. We either recover case 1 , or find the new solution $c=1, a=b=3$. This yields the solution to the original equation $(1,1,2,9)$\n",

We formulate the hypothesis that $c=n-1$ and $x_{k}=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-1 \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$.The condition $x_{n+1}=0$ makes the recurrence relation from the statement into a linear system in the unknowns $\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$.

For a larger value, consider an eigenvector $v$ of $A$. Then $\\left(A+\\mathcal{I}_{n}\\right) v=(c+1) v$, and $\\left(A+\\mathcal{I}_{n}\\right)^{n} v=(c+1)^{n} v$. The matrix $\\left(A+\\mathcal{I}_{n}\\right)^{n}$ has positive entries, and so by the Perron-Frobenius Theorem has a unique eigenvector with positive coordinates. We already found one such vector, that for which $x_{k}=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-1 \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$. Its eigenvalue has the largest absolute value among all eigenvalues of $\\left(A+\\mathcal{I}_{n}\\right)^{n}$, which means that $n^{n}>(c+1)^{n}$. This implies $n>c+1$, contradicting our assumption.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that the cars traveled on one day from $A$ to $B$ keeping a distance of at most one mile between them, and on the next day they traveled in opposite directions in the same time interval, which we assume to be of length one unit of time.Since the first car travels in both days on the same road and in the same direction, it defines two parametrizations of that road. Composing the motions of both cars during the second day of travel with a homeomorphism (continuous bijection) of the time interval $[0,1]$, we can ensure that the motion of the first car yields the same parametrization of the road on both days. Let $f(t)$ be the distance from the second car to $A$ when the first is at $t$ on the first day, and $g(t)$ the distance from the second car to $A$ when the first is at $t$ on the second day. These two functions are continuous, so their difference is also continuous.

        "Solution": "\n511. Without loss of generality, we may assume that the circle has radius 1 . If $a, b, c$ are the sides, and $S(a, b, c)$ the area, then (because of the formula $S=p r$, where $p$ is the semiperimeter) the constraint reads $S=\\frac{a+b+c}{2}$. We will maximize the function $f(a, b, c)=S(a, b, c)^{2}$ with the constraint $g(a, b, c)=S(a, b, c)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{a+b+c}{2}\\right)^{2}=0$. Using Hero's formula, we can write$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(a, b, c) &=\\frac{a+b+c}{2} \\cdot \\frac{-a+b+c}{2} \\cdot \\frac{a-b+c}{2} \\cdot \\frac{a+b-c}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{-a^{4}-b^{4}-c^{4}+2\\left(a^{2} b^{2}+b^{2} c^{2}+a^{2} c^{2}\\right)}{16} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$The method of Lagrange multipliers gives rise to the system of equations$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(\\lambda-1) \\frac{-a^{3}+a\\left(b^{2}+c^{2}\\right)}{4} &=\\frac{a+b+c}{2}, \\\\\n(\\lambda-1) \\frac{-b^{3}+b\\left(a^{2}+c^{2}\\right)}{4} &=\\frac{a+b+c}{2}, \\\\\n(\\lambda-1) \\frac{-c^{3}+c\\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\\right)}{4} &=\\frac{a+b+c}{2}, \\\\\ng(a, b, c) &=0 .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$Because $a+b+c \\neq 0, \\lambda$ cannot be 1 , so this further gives$$\n-a^{3}+a\\left(b^{2}+c^{2}\\right)=-b^{3}+b\\left(a^{2}+c^{2}\\right)=-c^{3}+c\\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\\right) .\n$$The first equality can be written as $(b-a)\\left(a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}\\right)=0$. This can happen only if either $a=b$ or $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$, so either the triangle is isosceles, or it is right. Repeating this for all three pairs of sides we find that either $b=c$ or $b^{2}+c^{2}=a^{2}$, and also that either $a=c$ or $a^{2}+c^{2}=b^{2}$. Since at most one equality of the form $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$ can hold, we see that, in fact, all three sides must be equal. So the critical point given by the method of Lagrange multipliers is the equilateral triangle.Is this the global minimum? We just need to observe that as the triangle degenerates, the area becomes infinite. So the answer is yes, the equilateral triangle minimizes the area.\n",

        "Solution": "\n528. We simplify the computation using Stokes' theorem:$$\n\\oint_{C} y^{2} d x+z^{2} d y+x^{2} d z=-2 \\iint_{S} y d x d y+z d y d z+x d z d x\n$$where $S$ is the portion of the sphere bounded by the Viviani curve. We have$$\n-2 \\iint_{S} y d x d y+z d y d z+x d z d x=-2 \\iint_{S}(z, x, y) \\cdot \\vec{n} d \\sigma,\n$$where $(z, x, y)$ denotes the three-dimensional vector with coordinates $z, x$, and $y$, while $\\vec{n}$ denotes the unit vector normal to the sphere at the point of coordinates $(x, y, z)$. We parametrize the portion of the sphere in question by the coordinates $(x, y)$, which range inside the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}-a x=0$. This circle is the projection of the Viviani curve onto the $x y$-plane.The unit vector normal to the sphere is$$\n\\vec{n}=\\left(\\frac{x}{a}, \\frac{y}{a}, \\frac{z}{a}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{x}{a}, \\frac{y}{a}, \\frac{\\sqrt{a^{2}-x^{2}-y^{2}}}{a}\\right),\n$$while the area element is$$\nd \\sigma=\\frac{1}{\\cos \\alpha} d x d y,\n$$$\\alpha$ being the angle formed by the normal to the sphere with the $x y$-plane. It is easy to see that $\\cos \\alpha=\\frac{z}{a}=\\frac{\\sqrt{a^{2}-x^{2}-y^{2}}}{a}$.

        "Solution": "\n554. Rewrite the equation $f^{2}+g^{2}=f^{\\prime 2}+g^{\\prime 2}$ as$$\n(f+g)^{2}+(f-g)^{2}=\\left(f^{\\prime}+g^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}+\\left(g^{\\prime}-f^{\\prime}\\right)^{2} .\n$$This, combined with $f+g=g^{\\prime}-f^{\\prime}$, implies that $(f-g)^{2}=\\left(f^{\\prime}+g^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}$.Let $x_{0}$ be the second root of the equation $f(x)=g(x)$. On the intervals $I_{1}=$ $(-\\infty, 0), I_{2}=\\left(0, x_{0}\\right)$, and $I_{3}=\\left(x_{0}, \\infty\\right)$ the function $f-g$ is nonzero; hence so is $f^{\\prime}+g^{\\prime}$. These two functions maintain constant sign on the three intervals; hence $f-g=\\epsilon_{j}\\left(f^{\\prime}+g^{\\prime}\\right)$ on $I_{j}$, for some $\\epsilon_{j} \\in\\{-1,1\\}, j=1,2,3$. If on any of these intervals $f-g=f^{\\prime}+g^{\\prime}$, then since $f+g=g^{\\prime}-f^{\\prime}$ it follows that $f=g^{\\prime}$ on that interval, and so $g^{\\prime}+g=g^{\\prime}-g^{\\prime \\prime}$. This implies that $g$ satisfies the equation $g^{\\prime \\prime}+g=0$, or that $g(x)=A \\sin x+B \\cos x$ on that interval. Also, $f(x)=g^{\\prime}(x)=A \\cos x-B \\sin x$.If $f-g=-f^{\\prime}-g^{\\prime}$ on some interval, then using again $f+g=g^{\\prime}-f^{\\prime}$, we find that $g=g^{\\prime}$ on that interval. Hence $g(x)=C_{1} e^{x}$. From the fact that $f=-f^{\\prime}$, we obtain $f(x)=C_{2} e^{-x}$.Assuming that $f$ and $g$ are exponentials on the interval $\\left(0, x_{0}\\right)$, we deduce that $C_{1}=g(0)=f(0)=C_{2}$ and that $C_{1} e^{x_{0}}=g\\left(x_{0}\\right)=f\\left(x_{0}\\right)=C_{2} e^{-x}$. These two inequalities cannot hold simultaneously, unless $f$ and $g$ are identically zero, ruled out by the hypothesis of the problem. Therefore, $f(x)=A \\cos x-B \\sin x$ and $g(x)=$ $A \\sin x+B \\cos x$ on $\\left(0, x_{0}\\right)$, and consequently $x_{0}=\\pi$.On the intervals $(-\\infty, 0]$ and $\\left[x_{0}, \\infty\\right)$ the functions $f$ and $g$ cannot be periodic, since then the equation $f=g$ would have infinitely many solutions. So on these intervals the functions are exponentials. Imposing differentiability at 0 and $\\pi$, we obtain $B=A$, $C_{1}=A$ on $I_{1}$ and $C_{1}=-A e^{-\\pi}$ on $I_{3}$ and similarly $C_{2}=A$ on $I_{1}$ and $C_{2}=-A e^{\\pi}$ on $I_{3}$.

For example, in the $x y$-plane we could map each point $(x, y)$ to the point $(y,-x)$.(b) Suppose such a bijection existed. In vector notation, the given condition states that$$\n(\\vec{a}-\\vec{b}) \\cdot(f(\\vec{a})-f(\\vec{b}))=0\n$$for any three-dimensional vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$.Assume without loss of generality that $f$ maps the origin to itself; otherwise, $g(\\vec{p})=$ $f(\\vec{p})-f(\\overrightarrow{0})$ is still a bijection and still satisfies the above equation. Plugging $\\vec{b}=$ $(0,0,0)$ into the above equation, we obtain that $\\vec{a} \\cdot f(\\vec{a})=0$ for all $\\vec{a}$.

The line intersects the side $B C$ where $\\delta(P, C A)=\\delta(P, A B)$, hence at the point $E$ where the angle bisector from $A$ intersects this side. It intersects side $C A$ at the point $F$ where the bisector from $B$ intersects the side. Also, $f(x, y)>0$ on side $A B$, hence on the same side of the line $E F$ as the segment $A B$.

Of greater practical importance is the Zhukovski transformation $z \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}\\left(z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right)$, which maps the unit circle onto the profile of the airplane wing (the so-called aerofoil). Because the Zhukovski map preserves angles, it helps reduce the study of the air flow around an airplane wing to the much simpler study of the air flow around a circle.\n",

Hence$$\nt^{2}(u-v)^{4}=\\frac{u^{3}-v^{3}}{u-v}=u^{2}+u v+v^{2}=(u-v)^{2}+3 u v\n$$or $(u-v)^{2}\\left[t^{2}(u-v)^{2}-1\\right]=3 u v$. It follows that $(u-v)^{2}$ divides $3 u v$, and since $u$ and $v$ are relatively prime and $u>v$, this can happen only if $u-v=1$. We obtain the equation $3 v(v+1)=t^{2}-1$, which is the same as$$\n(v+1)^{3}-v^{3}=t^{2}\n$$This was solved in the previous problem. The solutions to the original equation are then given by $x=(v+1) t, y=v t$, for any solution $(v, t)$ to this last equation.\\section{}\n",

Solving for $y$, we obtain$$\ny=-\\frac{x^{2}+4006 x+2003^{2}}{3 x+4006} .\n$$To make the expression on the right easier to handle we multiply both sides by 9 and write$$\n9 y=-3 x-8012-\\frac{2003^{2}}{3 x+4006} .\n$$If $(x, y)$ is an integer solution to the given equation, then $3 x+4006$ divides $2003^{2}$.

        "Solution": "\n875. The number of subsets with the sum of the elements equal to $n$ is the coefficient of $x^{n}$ in the product$$\nG(x)=(1+x)\\left(1+x^{2}\\right) \\cdots\\left(1+x^{p}\\right) .\n$$We are asked to compute the sum of the coefficients of $x^{n}$ for $n$ divisible by $p$. Call this number $s(p)$. There is no nice way of expanding the generating function; instead we compute $s(p)$ using particular values of $G$. It is natural to try $p$ th roots of unity.The first observation is that if $\\xi$ is a $p$ th root of unity, then $\\sum_{k=1}^{p} \\xi^{p}$ is zero except when $\\xi=1$. Thus if we sum the values of $G$ at the $p$ th roots of unity, only those terms with exponent divisible by $p$ will survive. To be precise, if $\\xi$ is a $p$ th root of unity different from 1, then$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{p} G\\left(\\xi^{k}\\right)=p s(p) .\n$$We are left with the problem of computing $G\\left(\\xi^{k}\\right), k=1,2, \\ldots, p$. For $k=p$, this is just $2^{p}$. For $k=1,2, \\ldots, p-1$,$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nG\\left(\\xi^{k}\\right) &=\\prod_{j=1}^{p}\\left(1+\\xi^{k j}\\right)=\\prod_{j=1}^{p}\\left(1+\\xi^{j}\\right)=(-1)^{p} \\prod_{j=1}^{p}\\left((-1)-\\xi^{j}\\right)=(-1)^{p}\\left((-1)^{p}-1\\right) \\\\\n&=2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$We therefore have $p s(p)=2^{p}+2(p-1)=2^{p}+2 p-2$. The answer to the problem is $s(p)=\\frac{2^{p}-2}{p}+2$. The expression is an integer because of Fermat's little theorem.$\n",

Determine all positive integers $n$ for which $B_{n}=\\{0\\}$.",
        "Solution": "\n878. We use the same generating functions as in the previous problem. So to the set $A_{n}$ we associate the function $$\na_{n} x=\\sum_{a=1}^{\\infty} c_{a} x^{a}\n$$with $c_{a}=1$ if $a \\in A_{n}$ and $c_{a}=0$ if $a \\notin A_{n}$. To $B_{n}$ we associate the function $b_{n}(x)$ in a similar manner. These functions satisfy the recurrence $a_{1}(x)=0, b_{1}(x)=1$,$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{n+1}(x) &=x b_{n}(x) \\\\\nb_{n+1} & \\equiv a_{n}(x)+b_{n}(x)(\\bmod 2)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$From now on we understand all equalities modulo 2. Let us restrict our attention to the sequence of functions $b_{n}(x), n=1,2, \\ldots$ It satisfies $b_{1}(x)=b_{2}(x)=1$,$$\nb_{n+1}(x)=b_{n}(x)+x b_{n-1}(x)\n$$We solve this recurrence the way one usually solves second-order recurrences, namely by finding two linearly independent solutions $p_{1}(x)$ and $p_{2}(x)$ satisfying$$\np_{i}(x)^{n+1}=p_{i}(x)^{n}+x p_{i}(x)^{n-1}, \\quad i=1,2 .\n$$Again the equality is to be understood modulo 2. The solutions $p_{1}(x)$ and $p_{2}(x)$ are formal power series whose coefficients are residue classes modulo 2 . They satisfy the \"characteristic\" equation$$\np(x)^{2}=p(x)+x\n$$which can be rewritten as$$\np(x)(p(x)+1)=x\n$$So $p_{1}(x)$ and $p_{2}(x)$ can be chosen as the factors of this product, and thus we may assume that $p_{1}(x)=x h(x)$ and $p_{2}(x)=1+p_{1}(x)$, where $h(x)$ is again a formal power series. Writing $p_{1}(x)=\\sum \\alpha_{a} x^{a}$ and substituting in the characteristic equation, we find that $\\alpha_{1}=1, \\alpha_{2 k}=\\alpha_{k}^{2}$, and $\\alpha_{2 k+1}=0$ for $k>1$. Therefore,$$\np_{1}(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^{2^{k}}\n$$Since $p_{1}(x)+p_{2}(x)=p_{1}(x)^{2}+p_{2}(x)^{2}=1$, it follows that in general,$$\nb_{n}(x)=p_{1}(x)^{n}+p_{2}(x)^{n}=\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^{2^{k}}\\right)^{n}+\\left(1+\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^{2^{k}}\\right)^{n}, \\quad \\text { for } n \\geq 1 .\n$$We emphasize again that this is to be considered modulo 2. In order for $b_{n}(x)$ to be identically equal to 1 modulo 2 , we should have$$\n\\left(\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^{2^{k}}\\right)+1\\right)^{n} \\equiv\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^{2^{k}}\\right)^{n}+1(\\bmod 2) .\n$$This obviously happens if $n$ is a power of 2 , since all binomial coefficients in the expansion are even.If $n$ is not a power of 2 , say $n=2^{i}(2 j+1), j \\geq 1$, then the smallest $m$ for which $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ m\\end{array}\\right)$ is odd is $2^{j}$. The left-hand side will contain an $x^{2^{j}}$ with coefficient equal to 1 , while the smallest nonzero power of $x$ on the right is $n$. Hence in this case equality cannot hold.We conclude that $B_{n}=\\{0\\}$ if and only if $n$ is a power of 2 .\n",

After examining several cases we guess that the maximal number of partitions is $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$. This is exactly the number of lines determined by two points, and we will use these lines to count the number of partitions.

If $A$ and $B$ agree to play until one of them loses all his\/her money, what is the probability of $A$ winning all the money?\n",
        "Solution": "\n925. Fix $N=m+n$, the total amount of money, and vary $m$. Denote by $P(m)$ the probability that $A$ wins all the money when starting with $m$ dollars. Clearly, $P(0)=0$ and $P(N)=1$. We want a recurrence relation for $P(m)$.Assume that $A$ starts with $k$ dollars. During the first game, $A$ can win, lose, or the game can be a draw. If $A$ wins this game, then the probability of winning all the money afterward is $P(k+1)$. If $A$ loses, the probability of winning in the end is $P(k-1)$. Finally, if the first game is a draw, nothing changes, so the probability of $A$ winning in the end remains equal to $P(k)$. These three situations occur with probabilities $p, q, r$, respectively; hence $$\nP(k)=p P(k+1)+q P(k-1)+r P(k) .\n$$Taking into account that $p+q+r=1$, we obtain the recurrence relation$$\np P(k+1)-(p+q) P(k)+q P(k-1)=0 .\n$$The characteristic equation of this recurrence is $p \\lambda^{2}-(p+q) \\lambda+q=0$. There are two cases. The simpler is $p=q$. Then the equation has the double root $\\lambda=1$, in which case the general term is a linear function in $k$. Since $P(0)=0$ and $P(N)=1$, it follows that $P(m)=\\frac{m}{N}=\\frac{m}{n+m}$.

Consider the convex $n$-gon whose vertices are these points. What is the probability that at least one of the vertex angles of this polygon is acute?\n",
        "Solution": "\n932. The angle at the vertex $P_{i}$ is acute if and only if all other points lie on an open semicircle facing $P_{i}$. We first deduce from this that if there are any two acute angles at all, they must occur consecutively. Otherwise, the two arcs that these angles subtend would overlap and cover the whole circle, and the sum of the measures of the two angles would exceed $180^{\\circ}$.So the polygon has either just one acute angle or two consecutive acute angles. In particular, taken in counterclockwise order, there exists exactly one pair of consecutive angles the second of which is acute and the first of which is not.We are left with the computation of the probability that for one of the points $P_{j}$, the angle at $P_{j}$ is not acute, but the following angle is. This can be done using integrals. But there is a clever argument that reduces the geometric probability to a probability with a finite number of outcomes. The idea is to choose randomly $n-1$ pairs of antipodal points, and then among these to choose the vertices of the polygon. A polygon with one vertex at $P_{j}$ and the other among these points has the desired property exactly when $n-2$ vertices lie on the semicircle to the clockwise side of $P_{j}$ and one vertex on the opposite semicircle. Moreover, the points on the semicircle should include the counterclockwisemost to guarantee that the angle at $P_{j}$ is not acute. Hence there are $n-2$ favorable choices of the total $2^{n-1}$ choices of points from the antipodal pairs. The probability for obtaining a polygon with the desired property is therefore $(n-2) 2^{-n+1}$.Integrating over all choices of pairs of antipodal points preserves the ratio. The events $j=1,2, \\ldots, n$ are independent, so the probability has to be multiplied by $n$. The answer to the problem is therefore $n(n-2) 2^{-n+1}$. \n",
