Let us replace them with $i+j-1$ and $(i+m)+(j+k)-1$, as shown in Figure 62. The product of the first pair is$$\ni^{2}+i k+i(j-1)+m i+m k+m(j-1)+(j-1) i+(j-1) k+(j-1)^{2},\n$$while the product of the second pair is$$\ni^{2}+i m+i k+i(j-1)+(j-1) m+(j-1) k+(j-1)^{2} .\n$$We can see that the first of these expressions exceeds the second by $m k$. This proves that if the permutation has an inversion, then the product is not minimal. The only permutation without inversions is the identity permutation.

","Solution":"\n138. Order the numbers $x_{1}<x_{2}<\\cdots<x_{n}$ and call the expression from the statement $E\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$. Note that $E\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)>\\frac{x_{n}^{2}}{n}$, which shows that as the variables tend to infinity, so does the expression. This means that the minimum exists. Assume that the minimum is attained at the point $\\left(y_{1}, y_{2}, \\ldots, y_{n}\\right)$. If $y_{n}-y_{1}>n$ then there exist indices $i$ and $j, i<j$, such that $y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{i}+1, \\ldots, y_{j}-1, \\ldots, y_{n}$ are still distinct integers.

We first try a function of the form $f(n)=n+a$. The relation from the statement yields $a=667$, and hence $f(n)=n+667$ is a solution.

Give an example of a continuous function on an interval that is nowhere differentiable.","Solution":"\n393. The first example of such a function was given by Weierstrass. The example we present here, of a function $f:[0,1] \\rightarrow[0,1]$, was published by S. Marcus in the Mathematics Gazette, Bucharest.If $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ and $x=0 . a_{1} a_{2} a_{3} \\ldots$ is the ternary expansion of $x$, we let the binary representation of $f(x)$ be $0 . b_{1} b_{2} b_{3} \\ldots$, where the binary digits $b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, \\ldots$ are uniquely determined by the conditions(i) $b_{1}=1$ if and only if $a_{1}=1$,(ii) $b_{n+1}=b_{n}$ if and only if $a_{n+1}=a_{n}, n \\geq 1$.It is not hard to see that $f(x)$ does not depend on which ternary representation you choose for $x$. For example,$$\nf(0.0222 \\ldots)=0.0111 \\cdots=0.1000 \\cdots=f(0.1000 \\ldots) .\n$$Let us prove first that the function is continuous. If $x$ is a number that has a unique ternary expansion and $\\left(x_{n}\\right)_{n}$ is a sequence converging to $x$, then the first $m$ digits of $x_{n}$ become equal to the first $m$ digits of $x$ for $n$ sufficiently large. It follows from the definition of $f$ that the first $m$ binary digits of $f\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ become equal to the first $m$ binary digits of $f(x)$ for $n$ sufficiently large. Hence $f\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ converges to $f(x)$, so $f$ is continuous at $x$.If $x$ is a number that has two possible ternary expansions, then in one expansion $x$ has only finitely many nonzero digits $x=0 . a_{1} a_{2} \\ldots a_{k} 00 \\ldots$, with $a_{k} \\neq 0$. The other expansion is $0 . a_{1} a_{2} \\ldots a_{k}^{\\prime} 222 \\ldots$, with $a_{k}^{\\prime}=a_{k}-1(=0$ or 1 ). Given a sequence $\\left(x_{n}\\right)_{n}$ that converges to $x$, for sufficiently large $n$ the first $k-1$ digits of $x_{n}$ are equal to $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{k-1}$, while the next $m-k+1$ are either $a_{k}, 0,0, \\ldots, 0$, or $a_{k}^{\\prime}, 2,2, \\ldots, 2$. If $f(x)=f\\left(0 . a_{1} a_{2} \\ldots a_{k} 00 \\ldots\\right)=0 . b_{1} b_{2} b_{3} \\ldots$, then for $n$ sufficiently large, the first $k-1$ digits of $f\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ are $b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{k-1}$, while the next $m-k+1$ are either $b_{k}, b_{k+1}=$ $b_{k+2}=\\cdots=b_{m}$ (the digits of $\\left.f(x)\\right)$ or $1-b_{k}, 1-b_{k+1}=\\cdots=1-b_{m}$. The two possible binary numbers are $0 . b_{1} b_{2} \\ldots b_{k-1} 0111 \\ldots$ and $0 . b_{1} b_{2} \\ldots b_{k-1} 1000 \\ldots$; they differ from $f(x)$ by at most $\\frac{1}{2^{m+1}}$. We conclude again that as $n \\rightarrow \\infty, f\\left(x_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow f(x)$. This proves the continuity of $f$.Let us show next that $f$ does not have a finite derivative from the left at any point $x \\in(0,1]$. For such $x$ consider the ternary expansion $x=0 . a_{1} a_{2} a_{3} \\ldots$ that has infinitely many nozero digits, and, applying the definition of $f$ for this expansion, let $f(x)=$ $0 . b_{1} b_{2} b_{3} \\ldots$.

Construct a number $x^{\\prime} \\in(0,1)$ whose first $k_{n}-1$ digits are the same as those of $x$, whose $k_{n}$ th digit is zero, and all of whose other digits are equal to 0 if $b_{k_{n}+1}=1$ and to 1 if $b_{k_{n}+1}=0$. Then$$\n0<x-x^{\\prime}<2 \\cdot 3^{-k_{n}}+0 . \\underbrace{00 \\ldots 0}_{k_{n}} 22 \\ldots, 0=3^{-k_{n}+1},\n$$while in the first case,$$\n\\left|f(x)-f\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)\\right| \\geq 0 . \\underbrace{00 \\ldots 0}_{k_{n}} b_{k_{n}+1}=0 . \\underbrace{00 \\ldots 0}_{k_{n}} 1,\n$$and in the second case,$$\n\\left|f(x)-f\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)\\right| \\geq 0 . \\underbrace{00 \\ldots 0}_{k_{n}} 11 \\ldots 1-0 . \\underbrace{00 \\ldots 0}_{k_{n}} 0 b_{k_{n}+2 \\ldots,}\n$$and these are both greater than or equal to $2^{-k_{n}-1}$.

Is it possible for the cars to travel the first one from $A$ to $B$ and the second one from $B$ to $A$ in such a way that the distance between them is always greater than one mile?\n","Solution":"\n399. Without loss of generality, we may assume that the cars traveled on one day from $A$ to $B$ keeping a distance of at most one mile between them, and on the next day they traveled in opposite directions in the same time interval, which we assume to be of length one unit of time.Since the first car travels in both days on the same road and in the same direction, it defines two parametrizations of that road. Composing the motions of both cars during the second day of travel with a homeomorphism (continuous bijection) of the time interval $[0,1]$, we can ensure that the motion of the first car yields the same parametrization of the road on both days. Let $f(t)$ be the distance from the second car to $A$ when the first is at $t$ on the first day, and $g(t)$ the distance from the second car to $A$ when the first is at $t$ on the second day. These two functions are continuous, so their difference is also continuous. But $f(0)-g(0)=-\\operatorname{dist}(A, B)$, and $f(1)-g(1)=\\operatorname{dist}(A, B)$, where $\\operatorname{dist}(A, B)$ is the distance between the cities.The intermediate value property implies that there is a moment $t$ for which $f(t)-$ $g(t)=0$. At that moment the two cars are in the same position as they were the day before, so they are at distance at most one mile.

In fact, we will prove a more general result.Proposition. Let $S$ be a set and $g: S \\rightarrow S$ a function that has exactly two fixed points $\\{a, b\\}$ and such that $g \\circ g$ has exactly four fixed points $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$. Then there is no function $f: S \\rightarrow S$ such that $g=f \\circ f$. Proof. Let $g(c)=y$. Then $c=g(g(c))=g(y)$; hence $y=g(c)=g(g(y))$. Thus $y$ is a fixed point of $g \\circ g$. If $y=a$, then $a=g(a)=g(y)=c$, leading to a contradiction. Similarly, $y=b$ forces $c=b$. If $y=c$, then $c=g(y)=g(c)$, so $c$ is a fixed point of $g$, again a contradiction. It follows that $y=d$, i.e., $g(c)=d$, and similarly $g(d)=c$.Suppose there is $f: S \\rightarrow S$ such that $f \\circ f=g$. Then $f \\circ g=f \\circ f \\circ f=g \\circ f$. Then $f(a)=f(g(a))=g(f(a))$, so $f(a)$ is a fixed point of $g$. Examining case by case, we conclude that $f(\\{a, b\\}) \\subset\\{a, b\\}$ and $f(\\{a, b, c, d\\}) \\subset\\{a, b, c, d\\}$. Because $f \\circ f=g$, the inclusions are, in fact, equalities.Consider $f(c)$. If $f(c)=a$, then $f(a)=f(f(c))=g(c)=d$, a contradiction since $f(a)$ is in $\\{a, b\\}$. Similarly, we rule out $f(c)=b$. Of course, $c$ is not a fixed point of $f$, since it is not a fixed point of $g$. We are left with the only possibility $f(c)=d$. But then $f(d)=f(f(c))=g(c)=d$, and this again cannot happen because $d$ is not a fixed point of $g$.

Its age-old theorems and the sharp logic of its proofs make you think of the words of Andrew Wiles, \"Mathematics seems to have a permanence that nothing else has.\"This chapter is bound to take you away from the geometry of the ancients, with figures and pictorial intuition, and bring you to the science of numbers and equations that geometry has become today. In a dense exposition we have packed vectors and their applications, analytical geometry in the plane and in space, some applications of integral calculus to geometry, followed by a list of problems with Euclidean flavor but based on algebraic and combinatorial ideas. Special attention is given to conics and quadrics, for their study already contains the germs of differential and algebraic geometry.Four subsections are devoted to geometry's little sister, trigonometry. We insist on trigonometric identities, repeated in subsequent sections from different perspectives: Euler's formula, trigonometric substitutions, and telescopic summation and multiplication.Since geometry lies at the foundation of mathematics, its presence could already be felt in the sections on linear algebra and multivariable calculus. It will resurface again in the chapter on combinatorics.","Solution":"\n572. The idea is to use an \"integrating factor\"' that transforms the quantity under the integral into the derivative of a function. We already encountered this situation in a previous problem, and should recognize that the integrating factor is $e^{-x}$. We can therefore write$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{0}^{1}\\left|f^{\\prime}(x)-f(x)\\right| d x &=\\int_{0}^{1}\\left|f^{\\prime}(x) e^{-x}-f(x) e^{-x}\\right| e^{x} d x=\\int_{0}^{1}\\left|\\left(f(x) e^{-x}\\right)^{\\prime}\\right| e^{x} d x \\\\\n& \\geq \\int_{0}^{1}\\left(f(x) e^{-x}\\right)^{\\prime} \\mid d x=f(1) e^{-1}-f(0) e^{-0}=\\frac{1}{e}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$We have found a lower bound. We will prove that it is the greatest lower bound. Define $f_{a}:[0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$$$\nf_{a}(x)= \\begin{cases}\\frac{e^{a-1}}{a} x & \\text { for } x \\in[0, a] \\\\ e^{x-1} & \\text { for } x \\in[a, 1]\\end{cases}\n$$The functions $f_{a}$ are continuous but not differentiable at $a$, but we can smooth this \"corner\"' without altering too much the function or its derivative. Ignoring this problem, we can write$$\n\\int_{0}^{1}\\left|f_{a}^{\\prime}(x)-f_{a}(x)\\right| d x=\\int_{0}^{a}\\left|\\frac{e^{a-1}}{a}-\\frac{e^{a-1}}{a} x\\right| d x=\\frac{e^{a-1}}{a}\\left(a-\\frac{a^{2}}{2}\\right)=e^{a-1}\\left(1-\\frac{a}{2}\\right)\n$$As $a \\rightarrow 0$, this expression approaches $\\frac{1}{e}$.

Find all regular polygons that can be inscribed in an ellipse with unequal semiaxes.\n","Solution":"\n611. An equilateral triangle can be inscribed in any closed, non-self-intersecting curve, therefore also in an ellipse. The argument runs as follows. Choose a point $A$ on the ellipse. Rotate the ellipse around $A$ by $60^{\\circ}$. The image of the ellipse through the rotation intersects the original ellipse once in $A$, so it should intersect it at least one more time. Let $B$ an be intersection point different from $A$. Note that $B$ is on both ellipses, and its preimage $C$ through rotation is on the original ellipse. The triangle $A B C$ is equilateral.A square can also be inscribed in the ellipse. It suffices to vary an inscribed rectangle with sides parallel to the axes of the ellipse and use the intermediate value property.Let us show that these are the only possibilities. Up to a translation, a rotation, and a dilation, the equation of the ellipse has the form$$\nx^{2}+a y^{2}=b, \\quad \\text { with } a, b>0, a \\neq 1 .\n$$Assume that a regular $n$-gon, $n \\geq 5$, can be inscribed in the ellipse.

We want to compute the distance from a point $\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}\\right)$ on this intersection to the origin. From the equation of the plane, we obtain by squaring$$\nx_{0}^{2}+z_{0}^{2}=b^{2}\\left(\\frac{x_{0}^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{z_{0}^{2}}{c^{2}}\\right) .\n$$The equation of the ellipsoid gives$$\ny_{0}^{2}=b^{2}\\left(1-\\frac{x_{0}^{2}}{a^{2}}-\\frac{z_{0}^{2}}{c^{2}}\\right) .\n$$Adding these two, we obtain $x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2}+z_{0}^{2}=1$; hence $\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}\\right)$ lies on the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin and contained in the plane $\\left(c \\sqrt{a^{2}-b^{2}}\\right) x+\\left(a \\sqrt{b^{2}-c^{2}}\\right) z=0$.

Setting $x=y=z=0$ we find that $f(0)=3(f(0))^{3}$. This cubic equation has the unique integer solution $f(0)=0$. Next, with $y=-x$ and $z=0$ we have $f(0)=$ $(f(x))^{3}+(f(-x))^{3}+(f(0))^{3}$, which yields $f(-x)=-f(x)$ for all integers $x$; hence $f$ is an odd function.

For $x>4$, suppose that $f(y)=y f(1)$ for all $y$ with $|y|<|x|$. Using the lemma write $x^{3}=x_{1}^{3}+x_{2}^{3}+x_{3}^{3}+x_{4}^{3}+x_{5}^{3}$, where $\\left|x_{i}\\right|<|x|$, $i=1,2,3,4,5$.

Find all pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with the property that $a b+a+b$ divides $a^{2}+b^{2}+1$.\n","Solution":"\n712. The divisibility condition can be written as$$\nk(a b+a+b)=a^{2}+b^{2}+1,\n$$where $k$ is a positive integer. The small values of $k$ are easy to solve. For example, $k=1$ yields $a b+a+b=a^{2}+b^{2}+1$, which is equivalent to $(a-b)^{2}+(a-1)^{2}+(b-1)^{2}=0$, whose only solution is $a=b=1$. Also, for $k=2$ we have $2 a b+2 a+2 b=a^{2}+b^{2}+1$. This can be rewritten either as $4 a=(b-a-1)^{2}$ or as $4 b=(b-a+1)^{2}$, showing that both $a$ and $b$ are perfect squares. Assuming that $a \\leq b$, we see that $(b-a-1)-(b-a+1)=2$, and hence $a$ and $b$ are consecutive squares. We obtain as an infinite family of solutions the pairs of consecutive perfect squares.Now let us examine the case $k \\geq 3$. This is where we apply Fermat's infinite descent method. Again we assume that $a \\leq b$. A standard approach is to interpret the divisibility condition as a quadratic equation in $b$ :$$\nb^{2}-k(a+1) b+\\left(a^{2}-k a+1\\right)=0 .\n$$Because one of the roots, namely $b$, is an integer, the other root must be an integer, too (the sum of the roots is $k(a+1)$ ). Thus we may substitute the pair $(a, b)$ by the smaller pair $(r, a)$, provided that $0<r<a$. Let us verify first that $0<r$. Assume the contrary. Since $b r=a^{2}-k a+1$, we must have $a^{2}-k a+1 \\leq 0$. The equality case is impossible, since $a(k-a)=1$ cannot hold if $k \\geq 3$. If $a^{2}-k a+1<0$, the original divisibility condition implies $b(b-a k-k)=a k-a^{2}-1>0$, hence $b-a k-k>0$. But then $b(b-a k-k)>$ $(a k+k) \\cdot 1>a k-a^{2}-1$, a contradiction. This proves that $r$ is positive. From the fact that $b r=a^{2}-k a+1<a^{2}$ and $b \\geq a$, it follows that $r<a$. Successively, we obtain the sequence of pairs of solutions to the original problem $\\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\\right)=(a, b),\\left(a_{2}, b_{2}\\right)=(r, a)$, $\\left(a_{3}, b_{3}\\right), \\ldots$, with $a_{i} \\leq b_{i}$ and $a_{1}>a_{2}>a_{3}>\\cdots, b_{1}>b_{2}>b_{3}>\\cdots$, which of course is impossible. This shows that the ratio of $a^{2}+b^{2}+1$ to $a b+a+b$ cannot be greater than or equal to 3 , and so the answer to the problem consists of the pair $(1,1)$ together with all pairs of consecutive perfect squares.\\section{}\n","Topic":"Probability","Book":"Putnam and Beyond","Final Answer":""},"715":{"Problem Number":"715","Problem Statement":"\n715.

First, we train combinatorial skills in set theory and geometry, with a glimpse at permutations. Then we turn to some specific techniques: generating functions, counting arguments, the inclusion-exclusion principle. A strong accent is placed on binomial coefficients.This is followed by probability, which, in fact, should be treated separately. But the level of this book restricts us to problems that use counting, classical schemes such as the Bernoulli and Poisson schemes and Bayes' theorem, recurrences, and some minor geometric considerations. It is only later in the development of mathematics that probability loses its combinatorial flavor and borrows the analytical tools of Lebesgue integration.","Solution":"\n820. First solution: The solutions are$$\n(v+1, v, 1,1), \\text { for all } v ; \\quad(2,1,1, y), \\text { for all } y ; \\quad(2,3,2,1),(3,2,2,3) .\n$$To show that these are the only solutions, we consider first the simpler case $v=$ $u+1$. Then $u^{x}-(u+1)^{y}=1$. Considering this equation modulo $u$, we obtain $-1 \\equiv u^{x}-(u+1)^{y}=1(\\bmod u)$. So $u=1$ or 2 . The case $u=1$ is clearly impossible, since then $v^{y}=0$, so we have $u=2, v=3$. We are left with the simpler equation $2^{x}-3^{y}=1$. Modulo 3 it follows that $x$ is even, $x=2 x^{\\prime}$. The equality $2^{2 x^{\\prime}}-1=\\left(2^{x^{\\prime}}-1\\right)\\left(2^{x^{\\prime}}+1\\right)=3^{y}$ can hold only if $x^{\\prime}=1$ (the only consecutive powers of 3 that differ by 2 are 1 and 3). So $x=2, y=1$, and we obtain the solution $(2,3,2,1)$.Now suppose that $u=v+1$. If $v=1$, then $u=2, x=1$, and $y$ is arbitrary. So we have found the solution $(2,1,2, y)$. If $v=2$, the equation reduces to $3^{x}-2^{y}=1$. If $y \\geq 2$, then modulo 4 we obtain that $x$ is even, $x=2 x^{\\prime}$, and so $3^{2 x^{\\prime}}-1=\\left(3^{x^{\\prime}}-1\\right)\\left(3^{x^{\\prime}}+\\right.$ 1) $=2^{y}$. Two consecutive powers of 2 differ by 2 if they are 2 and 4 . We find that either $x=y=1$ or $x=2, y=3$. This gives the solutions $(2,1,1,1)$ and $(3,2,2,3)$.So let us assume $v \\geq 3$. The case $y=1$ gives the solutions $(v+1, v, 1,1)$. If $y>1$, then $v^{2}$ divides $v^{y}$, so $1 \\equiv(v+1)^{x} \\equiv 0+\\left(\\begin{array}{l}x \\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right) v+1\\left(\\bmod v^{2}\\right)$, and therefore $v$ divides $x$. Considering the equation modulo $v+1$, we obtain $1 \\equiv(v+1)^{x}-v^{y} \\equiv$ $-(-1)^{y}(\\bmod (v+1))$. Since $v+1>2,1 \\not \\equiv-1(\\bmod (v+1))$, so $y$ must be odd. Now if $x=1$, then $v^{y}=v$, so $v=1$, giving again the family of solutions $(v+1, v, 1,1)$. So assume $x>1$. Then $(v+1)^{2}$ divides $(v+1)^{x}$, so$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n1 & \\equiv(v+1)^{x}-v^{y} \\equiv-(v+1-1)^{y} \\\\\n& \\equiv 0-\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\ny \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right)(v+1)(-1)^{y-1}-(-1)^{y} \\\\\n& \\equiv-y(v+1)+1\\left(\\bmod (v+1)^{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$Hence $v+1$ divides $y$. Since $y$ is odd, $v+1$ is odd and $v$ is even. Since $v$ divides $x$, $x$ is also even. Because $v$ is even and $v \\geq 3$, it follows that $v \\geq 4$. We will need the following result.Lemma. If $a$ and $q$ are odd, if $1 \\leq m<t$, and if $a^{2^{m} q} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{t}\\right)$, then $a \\equiv$ $\\pm 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{t-m}\\right)$.Proof. First, let us prove the property for $q=1$. We will do it by induction on $m$. For $m=1$ we have $a^{2}=(a-1)(a+1)$, so one of the factors is divisible by $2^{t-1}$. Assume that the property is true for $m-1$ and let us prove it for $m$. Factoring, we obtain $\\left(a^{2^{m-1}}+1\\right)\\left(a^{2^{m-1}}-1\\right)$. For $m \\geq 2$, the first factor is 2 modulo 4 , hence $a^{2^{m-1}}$ is 1 modulo $2^{t-1}$. From the induction hypothesis it follows that $a \\equiv \\pm 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{t-m}\\right)$ (note that $t-m=(t-1)-(m-1))$. For arbitrary $q$, from what we have proved so far it follows that $a^{q} \\equiv \\pm 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{t-m}\\right)$. Because $\\phi\\left(2^{t-m}\\right)=2^{t-m-1}$, by Euler's theorem $a^{2^{t-m-1}} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{t-m}\\right)$. Since $q$ is odd, we can find a positive integer $c$ such that $c q \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{t-m-1}\\right)$. Then $a \\equiv a^{c q} \\equiv$ $(\\pm 1)^{c} \\equiv \\pm 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{t-m}\\right)$, and the lemma is proved.Let us return to the problem. Let $x=2^{m} q$, where $m \\geq 1$ and $q$ is odd. Because $(v+1)^{x}-v^{y}=1$, clearly $y \\geq x$. We have shown that $v+1$ divides $y$, so $y \\geq v+1$. Let us prove that $y \\geq 2 m+1$. Indeed, if $m \\leq 2$ this holds since $y \\geq v+1 \\geq 5 \\geq 2 m+1$; otherwise, $y \\geq x=2^{m} q \\geq 2^{m} \\geq 2 m+1$.Looking at the equation modulo $2^{y}$, we have $(v+1)^{2^{m} q} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{y}\\right)$, because $2^{y}$ divides $v^{y}$. By the lemma this implies that $v+1 \\equiv \\pm 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{y-m}\\right)$. But $v+1 \\equiv$ $1\\left(\\bmod 2^{y-m}\\right)$ would imply that $2^{m+1}$ divides $v$, which is impossible since $v$ divides $x$. Therefore, $v+1 \\equiv-1\\left(\\bmod 2^{y-m}\\right)$ and $v \\equiv-2\\left(\\bmod 2^{y-m}\\right)$. In particular, $v \\geq 2^{y-m}-2$, so $y \\geq 2^{y-m}-1$. But since $y \\geq 2 m+1$ and $y \\geq 5$, it follows that $2^{y-m}-1>y$, a contradiction. This shows that there are no other solutions.Second solution: Begin as before until we reduce to the case $u=v+1$ and $v \\geq 3$. Then we use the following lemma.Lemma. Suppose $p^{s} \\geq 3$ is a prime power, $r \\geq 1$, and $a \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod p^{s}\\right)$, but not $\\bmod p^{s+1}$. If $a^{k} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod p^{r+s}\\right)$, then $p^{r}$ divides $k$.Proof. Write $a=1+c p^{s}+d p^{s+1}$, where $1 \\leq c \\leq p-1$. Then we compute $a^{k} \\equiv$ $1+k c p^{s}\\left(\\bmod p^{s+1}\\right)$, and$$\na^{p}=1+c p^{s+1}+d p^{s+2}+\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\np \\\\\n2\n\\end{array}\\right) p^{2 s}(c+d p)+\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\np \\\\\n3\n\\end{array}\\right) p^{3 s}(c+d p)^{3}+\\cdots .\n$$Since either $s \\geq 2$ or $p$ is odd, $p^{s+2}$ divides $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}p \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right) p^{2 s}$; hence the fourth term is zero $\\bmod p^{s+2}$. Since $s+2 \\leq 3 s$, the latter terms are also zero $\\bmod p^{s+2}$; hence $a^{p} \\equiv$ $1\\left(\\bmod p^{s+1}\\right)$, but not $\\bmod p^{s+2}$.We now proceed by induction on $r$. Since $r \\geq 1$, the first equation above shows that $p$ divides $k$, which is the base case. For the inductive step, we note that the second calculation above lets us apply the previous case to $\\left(a^{p}\\right)^{k \/ p}$.To use this lemma, let $p^{s} \\geq 3$ be the highest power of the prime $p$ that divides $v$. Then $u=v+1 \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod p^{s}\\right)$, but not $\\bmod p^{s+1}$, and $u^{x}=v^{y}+1 \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod p^{s y}\\right)$. Hence by the lemma, $p^{s(y-1)}$ divides $x$, and in particular, $x \\geq p^{s(y-1)} \\geq 3^{y-1}$. Thus either $x>y$ or $y=1$.Similarly, let $q^{t} \\geq 3$ be the highest power of the prime $q$ that divides $u$. Then $(-v)=1-u \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod q^{t}\\right)$, but not $\\bmod q^{t+1}$. Since $(-v)^{y} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod q^{t}\\right)$ and $(-v)^{y}=(-1)^{y}-(-1)^{y} u^{x} \\equiv(-1)^{y}\\left(\\bmod q^{t}\\right)$, we see that $y$ is even. Hence $(-v)^{y}=$ $1-u^{x} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod q^{t x}\\right)$. Thus by the lemma, $q^{t(x-1)}$ divides $y$, and in particular, $y \\geq$ $q^{t(x-1)} \\geq 3^{x-1}$, so either $y>x$ or $x=1$. Combining these, we see that we must have either $x=1$ or $y=1$. Either of these implies the other and gives the solution $(v+1, v, 1,1)$.Remark. Catalan conjectured in 1844 a more general fact, namely that the Diophantine equation $u^{x}-v^{y}=1$ subject to the condition $x, y \\geq 2$ has the unique solution $3^{2}-2^{3}=1$. This would mean that 8 and 9 are the only consecutive powers. Catalan's conjecture was proved by P. Mih\u0103ilescu in 2002.(Kvant (Quantum), first solution by R. Barton, second solution by R.

Let $S=\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2004\\}$. Write the permutation as a function $f: S \\rightarrow S$, $f(n)=a_{n}, n=1,2, \\ldots, 2004$. We start by noting three properties of $f$ :(i) $f(i) \\neq i$ for any $i$,(ii) $f(i) \\neq f(j)$ if $i \\neq j$,(iii) $f(i)=j$ implies $f(j)=i$. The first two properties are obvious, while the third requires a proof. Arguing by contradiction, let us assume that $f(i)=j$ but $f(j) \\neq i$. We discuss first the case $j>i$. If we let $k=j-i$, then $f(i)=i+k$. Since $k=|f(i)-i|=|f(j)-j|$ and $f(j) \\neq i$, it follows that $f(j)=i+2 k$, i.e., $f(i+k)=i+2 k$. The same reasoning yields $f(i+2 k)=i+k$ or $i+3 k$. Since we already have $f(i)=i+k$, the only possibility is $f(i+2 k)=i+3 k$. And the argument can be repeated to show that $f(i+n k)=i+(n+1) k$ for all $n$. However, this then forces $f$ to attain ever increasing values, which is impossible since its range is finite. A similar argument takes care of the case $j<i$. This proves (iii).The three properties show that $f$ is an involution on $S$ with no fixed points. Thus $f$ partitions $S$ into 1002 distinct pairs $(i, j)$ with $i=f(j)$ and $j=f(i)$. Moreover, the absolute value of the difference of the elements in any pair is the same. If $f(1)-1=k$ then $f(2)=k+1, \\ldots, f(k)=2 k$, and since $f$ is an involution, the values of $f$ on $k+1, k+2, \\ldots, 2 k$ are already determined, namely $f(k+1)=1, f(k+2)=$ $2, \\ldots, f(2 k)=k$. So the first block of $2 k$ integers is invariant under $f$. Using similar reasoning, we obtain $f(2 k+1)=3 k+1, f(2 k+2)=3 k+2, \\ldots, f(3 k)=4 k, f(3 k+$ $1)=2 k+1, \\ldots, f(4 k)=3 k$. So the next block of $2 k$ integers is invariant under $f$. Continuing this process, we see that $f$ partitions $S$ into blocks of $2 k$ consecutive integers that are invariant under $f$. This can happen only if $2 k$ divides 2004 , hence if $k$ divides 1002. Furthermore, for each such $k$ we can construct $f$ following the recipe given above.

Therefore, the $m$-gon has either exactly one acute angle, or has two acute angles and they share a side.To count the number of such $m$-gons we employ the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

Counting by the number of interiors of small cubes that the diagonal leaves, we find that the number of interiors that $O A$ intersects is equal to the number of points on $O A$ having at least one integer coordinate.

The angle at the vertex $P_{i}$ is acute if and only if all other points lie on an open semicircle facing $P_{i}$.

Otherwise, the two arcs that these angles subtend would overlap and cover the whole circle, and the sum of the measures of the two angles would exceed $180^{\\circ}$.So the polygon has either just one acute angle or two consecutive acute angles. In particular, taken in counterclockwise order, there exists exactly one pair of consecutive angles the second of which is acute and the first of which is not.We are left with the computation of the probability that for one of the points $P_{j}$, the angle at $P_{j}$ is not acute, but the following angle is. This can be done using integrals. But there is a clever argument that reduces the geometric probability to a probability with a finite number of outcomes. The idea is to choose randomly $n-1$ pairs of antipodal points, and then among these to choose the vertices of the polygon.

The probability for obtaining a polygon with the desired property is therefore $(n-2) 2^{-n+1}$.Integrating over all choices of pairs of antipodal points preserves the ratio.

The pair $(p, q)$ is chosen randomly from the three-dimensional domain $C \\times$ int $C$, which has a total volume of $2 \\pi^{2}$ (here int $C$ denotes the interior of $C$ ). For a fixed $p$, the locus of points $q$ for which $R$ does not have points outside of $C$ is the rectangle whose diagonal is the diameter through $p$ and whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes (Figure 112).

If a needle of length 1 is dropped at random on a surface ruled with parallel lines at distance 2 apart, what is the probability that the needle will cross one of the lines?\n","Solution":"\n934. Mark an endpoint of the needle. Translations parallel to the given (horizontal) lines can be ignored; thus we can assume that the marked endpoint of the needle always falls on the same vertical. Its position is determined by the variables $(x, \\theta)$, where $x$ is the distance to the line right above and $\\theta$ the angle made with the horizontal (Figure 113).The pair $(x, \\theta)$ is randomly chosen from the region $[0,2) \\times[0,2 \\pi)$. The area of this region is $4 \\pi$. The probability that the needle will cross the upper horizontal line is$$\n\\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\sin \\theta} d x d \\theta=\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{4 \\pi} d \\theta=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi},\n$$which is also equal to the probability that the needle will cross the lower horizontal line. The probability for the needle to cross either the upper or the lower horizontal line is therefore $\\frac{1}{\\pi}$. This gives an experimental way of approximating $\\pi$.(G.-L.
