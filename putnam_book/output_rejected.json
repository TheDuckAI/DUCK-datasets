        "Solution": "64. We call a number good if it satisfies the given condition. It is not difficult to see that all powers of primes are good. Suppose $n$ is a good number that has at least two distinct prime factors. Let $n=p^{r} s$, where $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $n$ and $s$ is not divisible by $p$. Because $n$ is good, $p+s-1$ must divide $n$. For any prime $q$ dividing $s, s<p+s-1<s+q$, so $q$ does not divide $p+s-1$. Therefore, the only prime factor of $p+s-1$ is $p$. Then $s=p^{c}-p+1$ for some integer $c>1$. Because $p^{c}$ must also divide $n, p^{c}+s-1=2 p^{c}-p$ divides $n$. Because $2 p^{c-1}-1$ has no factors of $p$, it must divide $s$. But$$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{p-1}{2}\\left(2 p^{c-1}-1\\right) &=p^{c}-p^{c-1}-\\frac{p-1}{2}<p^{c}-p+1<\\frac{p+1}{2}\\left(2 p^{c-1}-1\\right) \\\\ &=p^{c}+p^{c-1}-\\frac{p+1}{2}, \\end{aligned} $$a contradiction.

And indeed, in an inductive manner we see that $f(n)=n+1$ implies $n+1+2 f(n+1)=3 n+5$; hence $f(n+1)=n+2$.The case $f(1)=4$ gives $4+2 f(4)=8$, so $f(4)=2$.

The product of all these ratios is $a_{0} / a_{1995}=1$, which means that the product of some $m$ primes equals the product of some $1995-m$ primes. This can happen only when the primes are the same (by unique factorization), and in particular they must be in the same number on both sides.

Set $s=a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{m}$, and let $n$ be the smallest positive integer that is not yet a term of the sequence.

If $y_{n}-y_{1}>n$ then there exist indices $i$ and $j, i<j$, such that $y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{i}+1, \\ldots, y_{j}-1, \\ldots, y_{n}$ are still distinct integers.

        "Solution": "539. No! In fact, we will prove a more general result.Proposition. Let $S$ be a set and $g: S \\rightarrow S$ a function that has exactly two fixed points $\\{a, b\\}$ and such that $g \\circ g$ has exactly four fixed points $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$. Then there is no function $f: S \\rightarrow S$ such that $g=f \\circ f$. Proof. Let $g(c)=y$. Then $c=g(g(c))=g(y)$; hence $y=g(c)=g(g(y))$. Thus $y$ is a fixed point of $g \\circ g$. If $y=a$, then $a=g(a)=g(y)=c$, leading to a contradiction. Similarly, $y=b$ forces $c=b$. If $y=c$, then $c=g(y)=g(c)$, so $c$ is a fixed point of $g$, again a contradiction. It follows that $y=d$, i.e., $g(c)=d$, and similarly $g(d)=c$.Suppose there is $f: S \\rightarrow S$ such that $f \\circ f=g$. Then $f \\circ g=f \\circ f \\circ f=g \\circ f$. Then $f(a)=f(g(a))=g(f(a))$, so $f(a)$ is a fixed point of $g$. Examining case by case, we conclude that $f(\\{a, b\\}) \\subset\\{a, b\\}$ and $f(\\{a, b, c, d\\}) \\subset\\{a, b, c, d\\}$. Because $f \\circ f=g$, the inclusions are, in fact, equalities.Consider $f(c)$. If $f(c)=a$, then $f(a)=f(f(c))=g(c)=d$, a contradiction since $f(a)$ is in $\\{a, b\\}$. Similarly, we rule out $f(c)=b$. Of course, $c$ is not a fixed point of $f$, since it is not a fixed point of $g$. We are left with the only possibility $f(c)=d$. But then $f(d)=f(f(c))=g(c)=d$, and this again cannot happen because $d$ is not a fixed point of $g$. We conclude that such a function $f$ cannot exist.In the particular case of our problem, $g(x)=x^{2}-2$ has the fixed points $-1$ and 2 , and $g(g(x))=\\left(x^{2}-2\\right)^{2}-2$ has the fixed points $-1,2, \\frac{-1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, and $\\frac{-1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.

For example, $\\mathcal{T}_{5}(a)=a^{5}-5 a^{3}+5 a$. This translates into the trigonometric identity $2 \\cos 5 \\theta=(2 \\cos \\theta)^{5}-5(2 \\cos \\theta)^{3}+5(2 \\cos \\theta)$.Add to the third equation of the system the first multiplied by 5 and the second multiplied by $-5$, then use the above-mentioned trigonometric identity to obtain$$ 2 \\cos 5 t_{1}+2 \\cos 5 t_{2}+2 \\cos 5 t_{3}+2 \\cos 5 t_{4}+2 \\cos 5 t_{5}=-10 . $$This can happen only if $\\cos 5 t_{1}=\\cos 5 t_{2}=\\cos 5 t_{3}=\\cos 5 t_{5}=\\cos 5 t_{5}=-1$. Hence$$ t_{1}, t_{2}, t_{3}, t_{4}, t_{5} \\in\\left\\{\\frac{\\pi}{5}, \\frac{3 \\pi}{5}, \\frac{5 \\pi}{5}\\right\\} . $$Using the fact that the roots of $x^{5}=1$, respectively, $x^{10}=1$, add up to zero, we deduce that$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\cos \\frac{2 k \\pi}{5}=0 \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\sum_{k=0}^{9} \\cos \\frac{k \\pi}{5}=0 . $$It follows that$$ \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{5}+\\cos \\frac{3 \\pi}{5}+\\cos \\frac{5 \\pi}{5}+\\cos \\frac{7 \\pi}{5}+\\cos \\frac{9 \\pi}{5}=0 . $$Since $\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{5}=\\cos \\frac{9 \\pi}{5}$ and $\\cos \\frac{3 \\pi}{5}=\\cos \\frac{7 \\pi}{5}$, we find that $\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{5}+\\cos \\frac{3 \\pi}{5}=\\frac{1}{2}$. Also, it is not hard to see that the equation $\\mathcal{T}_{5}(a)=-2$ has no rational solutions, which implies that $\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{5}$ is irrational.The first equation of the system yields $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} t_{i}=0$, and the above considerations show that this can happen only when two of the $t_{i}$ are equal to $\\frac{\\pi}{5}$, two are equal to $\\frac{3 \\pi}{5}$, and one is equal to $\\pi$. Let us show that in this situation the second equation is also satisfied. Using $\\mathcal{T}_{3}(a)=a^{3}-3 a$, we see that the first two equations are jointly equivalent to $\\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\cos t_{i}=0$ and $\\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\cos 3 t_{i}=0$. Thus we are left to check that this last equality is satisfied.

For example, $k=1$ yields $a b+a+b=a^{2}+b^{2}+1$, which is equivalent to $(a-b)^{2}+(a-1)^{2}+(b-1)^{2}=0$, whose only solution is $a=b=1$. Also, for $k=2$ we have $2 a b+2 a+2 b=a^{2}+b^{2}+1$. This can be rewritten either as $4 a=(b-a-1)^{2}$ or as $4 b=(b-a+1)^{2}$, showing that both $a$ and $b$ are perfect squares.

Again we assume that $a \\leq b$. A standard approach is to interpret the divisibility condition as a quadratic equation in $b$ :$$ b^{2}-k(a+1) b+\\left(a^{2}-k a+1\\right)=0 . $$Because one of the roots, namely $b$, is an integer, the other root must be an integer, too (the sum of the roots is $k(a+1)$ ). Thus we may substitute the pair $(a, b)$ by the smaller pair $(r, a)$, provided that $0<r<a$. Let us verify first that $0<r$. Assume the contrary. Since $b r=a^{2}-k a+1$, we must have $a^{2}-k a+1 \\leq 0$. The equality case is impossible, since $a(k-a)=1$ cannot hold if $k \\geq 3$. If $a^{2}-k a+1<0$, the original divisibility condition implies $b(b-a k-k)=a k-a^{2}-1>0$, hence $b-a k-k>0$. But then $b(b-a k-k)>$ $(a k+k) \\cdot 1>a k-a^{2}-1$, a contradiction. This proves that $r$ is positive. From the fact that $b r=a^{2}-k a+1<a^{2}$ and $b \\geq a$, it follows that $r<a$. Successively, we obtain the sequence of pairs of solutions to the original problem $\\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\\right)=(a, b),\\left(a_{2}, b_{2}\\right)=(r, a)$, $\\left(a_{3}, b_{3}\\right), \\ldots$, with $a_{i} \\leq b_{i}$ and $a_{1}>a_{2}>a_{3}>\\cdots, b_{1}>b_{2}>b_{3}>\\cdots$, which of course is impossible. This shows that the ratio of $a^{2}+b^{2}+1$ to $a b+a+b$ cannot be greater than or equal to 3 , and so the answer to the problem consists of the pair $(1,1)$ together with all pairs of consecutive perfect squares.\\section{(Mathematics Magazine)}",

        "Solution": "98. First, note that $\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} \\geq 0$ implies $x-\\frac{1}{4} \\leq x^{2}$, for all real numbers $x$.

        "Solution": "563. The equation is of Laplace type, but we can bypass the standard method once we make the following observation. The associated homogeneous equation can be written as$$ x\\left(y^{\\prime \\prime}+4 y^{\\prime}+4 y\\right)-\\left(y^{\\prime \\prime}+5 y^{\\prime}+6 y\\right)=0, $$and the equations $y^{\\prime \\prime}+4 y^{\\prime}+4 y=0$ and $y^{\\prime \\prime}+5 y^{\\prime}+6 y=0$ have the common solution $y(x)=e^{-2 x}$. This will therefore be a solution to the homogeneous equation, as well. To find a solution to the inhomogeneous equation, we use the method of variation of the constant. Set $y(x)=C(x) e^{-2 x}$. The equation becomes$$ (x-1) C^{\\prime \\prime}-C^{\\prime}=x \\text {, } $$with the solution$$ C^{\\prime}(x)=\\lambda(x-1)+(x-1) \\ln |x-1|-1 . $$Integrating, we obtain$$ C(x)=\\frac{1}{2}(x-1)^{2} \\ln |x-1|+\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{2}-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)(x-1)^{2}-x+C_{1} . $$If we set $c_{2}=\\frac{\\lambda}{2}-\\frac{1}{4}$, then the general solution to the equation is$$ y(x)=e^{-2 x}\\left[C_{1}+C_{2}(x-1)^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}(x-1)^{2} \\ln |x-1|-x\\right] . $$(D.
