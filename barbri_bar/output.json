One afternoon, Collector took out a World War II vintage handgun for cleaning. He carefully cleaned and oiled the weapon and then reloaded it. Just as he had finished with the reloading, Collector received a phone call from his girlfriend inviting him to dinner. Collector drove off and left the gun on his desk. That night a thief entered Collector's house, which was unlocked, and the gun was stolen. The next day, a convenience store located a few blocks from Collector's house was robbed, and the robber shot and seriously injured Seller, the store owner.

        "Explanation": " The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits state dilution of the right to vote by malapportionment of electoral districts. This rule applies to electoral districts for local governmental bodies as well as for the state legislature. When a local government establishes voting districts for the election of representatives, it must establish districts that do not have a significant variance in the number of persons in each district. Here, the Paulopolis districts have twice as many persons as the St. Minny districts, creating an unconstitutional dilution of the Paulopolis citizens' right to vote. (A) is incorrect. The clause in Article IV, Section 4 guaranteeing a \"republican form of government\" to the states has been judged by the Court to involve a political question. The Court will therefore decline to address that issue. (C) is incorrect because the Article IV Privileges and Immunities Clause, which provides that citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states, only prohibits a state from discriminating in favor of its own citizens and against citizens of other states with regard to \"fundamental rights,\" i.e., those involving important commercial activities or civil liberties. Here, out-of-state citizens are not being discriminated against, so the clause is not applicable. (D) is incorrect because the Due Process Clause is usually used to review a law that limits the liberty of all persons to engage in some activity, whereas the Equal Protection Clause is implicated when a law limits the liberty or rights of some persons but not others. The option raising the equal protection argument is therefore the better choice.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Dorit's strongest basis for challenging her denial of benefits by the federal government is the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Dorit's argument is that the regulations for determining who receives benefits create arbitrary and discriminatory classifications among similarly situated groups. Such classifications by a state government can be challenged under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but there is no counterpart to this clause applicable to the federal government. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has held that grossly unreasonable discrimination by the federal government violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and has applied the same standards that it uses in equal protection actions against a state. Hence, this clause constitutes Dorit's only plausible basis for a suit challenging the regulations. (A) is wrong because the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to states and not the federal government, and because it protects only certain privileges and immunities of national citizenship, none of which are implicated in this question. (B) is wrong because, as discussed above, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to the federal government. (D) is incorrect because a bill of attainder is a legislative act that inflicts punishment without a judicial trial on individuals who are designated either by name or in terms of past conduct.

        "Explanation": " A law containing gender-based classifications must be shown by its proponent to be substantially related to important government interests. State laws that discriminate by treating people in similar situations in dissimilar ways are subject to challenge under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court usually applies one of three tests for evaluating an equal protection challenge to a statute. Where the classification relates to who may exercise a fundamental right or is based on a \"suspect\" characteristic, the classification must be necessary to promote a compelling state interest. Where the classification relates only to matters of economics or social welfare, it is valid if it is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. For quasi-suspect classifications, the Court has applied an intermediate standard, upholding the law if its proponent can show, by an exceedingly persuasive justification, that the classification is substantially related to important governmental interests. A distinction based on gender, such as the provision in the Margate statute for free financial counseling to single mothers but not to single fathers in the same financial situation, is a quasi-suspect classification. Thus, to win the case, Margate must show that favoring mothers over fathers is substantially related to an important governmental interest. (A) is incorrect because a classification based on gender is subject to an intermediate level of scrutiny, requiring a \"substantial\" rather than \"rational\" relation and an \"important\" governmental interest rather than merely a \"legitimate\" governmental interest. (B) is incorrect because gender is not a suspect classification that requires the compelling state interest test to be applied. Even if it were, Peter would not have the burden of proving absence of a compelling interest; Margate would have to prove the existence of a compelling interest for the law to be upheld. (D) is wrong for similar reasons: gender is an \"almost suspect\" class that requires a showing of more than just a rational relationship, and, even if that test were appropriate, it would require Peter to bear the burden of demonstrating that the law does $\\boldsymbol{n o t}$ have a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. \n\n",

        "Explanation": " New Jingo cannot show a compelling state interest for treating resident aliens differently from other residents. Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, no state may deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. If a government statute classifies persons based on a \"suspect\" class, strict scrutiny will be applied (i.e., the statute will be upheld only if it is necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose). State and local laws based on a person's alienage are subject to strict scrutiny; the state must show a compelling state interest to justify the disparate treatment. Here, Josh is a resident of New Jingo. The statute treats him differently from other residents, however, because of his status as an alien-all resident aliens are scrutinized to determine whether they were citizens of a country that had taken United States citizens hostage. The state here has no compelling interest to justify the classification; the statute appears to be simply a political statement on a foreign policy matter that the state has no power over. Hence, the Equal Protection Clause is Josh's best argument to strike down the statute. (A) is incorrect for two reasons: the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to citizens of the United States, and it only protects certain attributes of national citizenship (such as the right to vote for federal officials). Here, Josh is not a citizen of the United States, and the right to a higher education at a state university is not an attribute of national citizenship. (B) is incorrect because an ex post facto law is legislation that retroactively alters the criminal law in a substantially prejudicial manner. It does not apply to retroactive alteration of civil regulations, such as the right to attend a state university. (D) is wrong because Josh would have to overcome several hurdles to make an effective due process argument. Procedural due process principles, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, provide that government shall not take a person's life, liberty, or property without due process of law. While property includes more than personal belongings, an abstract need for or unilateral expectation of the benefit is not enough. There must be a legitimate claim or \"entitlement\" to the benefit under state law. While there is a property interest in public education when school attendance is required, the Supreme Court has never specifically held that a property interest exists in public education at the college level. [See Board of Curators v. Horowitz (1978)] Even if Josh could persuade the court to make that assumption, he would also have to establish that imposing the higher tuition effectively deprives him of that property interest and that the registrar's procedures for denying him the lower tuition rate did not satisfy constitutional requirements. At best, he could require the university to give him a hearing before charging him the higher tuition. To strike down the statute itself, however, Josh's best argument is based on the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Timon's constitutional arguments will fail because his firing by the school did not constitute state action. The Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause, which makes many of the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, does not apply to purely private conduct that interferes with these rights. Thus, unless the private individual (i) was performing exclusively public functions, or (ii) took actions with significant state involvement, the individual's action is not unconstitutional. In this case, The Classical School is a private institution performing a function-education-that has never been considered to be an exclusively public function. [See Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925)] Furthermore, its licensing by the state and receipt of state funds do not constitute significant state involvement with regard to its personnel matters; thus, Timon cannot establish that the school exercised state action. [See Rendell-Baker v. Kohn (1982)] (A) is incorrect because constitutional protection for freedom of speech does not extend to actions taken by private individuals.

Immediately across the river, on the east bank, was Paulopolis, a city of 60,000 . Over the years, many civic improvement groups urged that the two municipalities be merged into \"Minnypaulos,\" a single city of 90,000 souls. The arguments in favor of merger stressed savings to taxpayers accruing from the elimination of duplicate services. Proposals to merge the two places had appeared as referenda on the ballot on two separate occasions. Although the voters of Paulopolis approved each proposal by heavy margins, the voters of St. Minny, fearing that control of the government would be in the hands of more populous Paulopolis, rejected the referendum proposals by more than two to one.\n\nTo avoid the failure of yet another such referendum, a new proposal was made for the governance of the proposed combined city. For a period of 20 years, beginning at the date of the merger, the city council of the merged city would consist of six persons. The former Paulopolis would be divided into three council districts, as would the former city of St. Minny. Thus, each St. Minny council representative would be elected from a district with a population of 10,000, while the Paulopolis districts would contain 20,000 persons each. A mayor would be elected at large. The proposal was placed on the ballot and was carried by large majorities in both St. Minny and Paulopolis. Representatives from Paulopolis and St. Minny carved each former city into three council electoral districts. Three Paulopolis taxpayers filed suit to enjoin the holding of an election with council districts of such disparate proportions.\n\nWhich of the following represents the plaintiffs' best constitutional argument?\n",

        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": " Babe can recover because, under the modern trend, the preexisting duty rule does not apply if the duty is owed to a third person. Generally, contracts must be supported by consideration. A promise to perform is valid consideration, but if a person already owes a duty to perform, traditionally that performance cannot be used as consideration for another promise. Thus, under the traditional rule, Babe could not enforce Joe's promise to pay Babe $\\$ 5,000$ if Babe hit a home run because Babe gave no valid consideration in exchange for Joe's promise, since Babe owed a preexisting duty to his ball club to exert his best efforts to hit home runs. However, under the modern view as formulated in Restatement (Second) of Contracts, section 73 , a duty is a preexisting duty only if it is owed to the promisor. Thus, a promise to perform a duty is valid consideration as long as the duty of performance is not already owed to the promisee. In other words, if the duty is owed to a third party, a promise to perform given to another is valid consideration as long as it was bargained for. (B) is incorrect because there is no exception to the preexisting duty rule-modern or otherwise-that allows the promisor to recover merely because his performance benefited the third party. Babe can recover under the modern approach because his promise to Jimmy's father was bargained for. Conversely, Babe does not have to prove that the value of his home run to Jimmy was at least $\\$ 5,000$, because courts generally will not inquire into the adequacy of consideration. (C) would be correct under the traditional rule, but this question is one of the few questions where you are asked about and expected to know the modern trend. As explained above, under the modern trend, the promise here is valid consideration because the duty to hit home runs was owed to a third party (the ball club) rather than to the promisee (Joe). (D) is wrong because while it is true that moral consideration is not good consideration, Joe did not rely on moral consideration, but rather exchanged a promise to pay $\\$ 5,000$ for Babe's performance.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Bernaise and Hollandaise formed a contract when they agreed on all salient points after negotiations. One element of their agreement was that the terms would be put in writing, a process sometimes called \"memorializing\" the agreement. The writing does not constitute the agreement itself, but is merely a written record of it. Another element of their oral agreement concerned when it would take effect: upon completion of the \"memorialization.\" Hobson's failure to initial the writing, whether deliberate or inadvertent, was not the failure of a condition, but rather a breach of the oral agreement that he would do so. (A) is incorrect because the oral agreement was already in effect at the time the writing was mailed. The processes of offer and acceptance took place during the oral negotiations. Even if the mailing of the writing could somehow be seen as an offer, there are no facts, such as detrimental reliance, that show it to be irrevocable. (C) is incorrect because the better view, as described above, is that the writing was a memorial of the existing oral agreement. Even if the requirement of Hobson's initialing were an express condition, Hollandaise would probably not be permitted to prevent the occurrence of the condition and then claim the benefit of its nonoccurrence. (D) is incorrect because acceptance had already taken place upon the parties' reaching oral agreement. This choice appears to invoke the mailbox rule but gets it wrong, since a mailed acceptance is generally effective upon posting (which occurred prior to the phone call), not upon receipt.

        "Explanation": " The extreme difficulty and expense of repairing or replacing the oven constitutes a good faith reason for FGF to cancel the contract, as it is entitled to do under the contract. Thus, GM will not prevail. Reservation of an unqualified right to cancel or withdraw from a contract at any time may amount to an illusory promise. However, the promise is not illusory, and there is a valid consideration, if the right to cancel is restricted in any way. Here, the right of either FGF or GM to cancel is restricted because it must be preceded by reasonable notice to the other party. In addition, the Code's implied requirement of good faith in all sales contracts imposes an additional restriction on the parties' right to cancel. Therefore, the promises are not illusory, and both parties are bound. FGF finds itself confronted with circumstances that present extreme and unreasonable difficulty and expense in complying with its contractual duties of supplying pate. While this additional test might not be sufficient to discharge FGF's duties on grounds of impracticability, it is clearly grounds for supplying FGF with a good faith reason for canceling the contract. (A) is incorrect because FGF is entitled to cancel the contract for a good faith reason upon giving reasonable notice. It is not necessary to show impossibility. (B) is incorrect because the fact that the parties agreed to a cancellation provision indicates that FGF did not assume all risks of increased expenses in making pate. The unreasonable amount of expense and difficulty involved with the repair and/or replacement of the oven supports FGF's good faith decision to cancel the contract. (D) is incorrect because, while some courts have found promises to be illusory if the contract provided for an unqualified right to cancel the contract at any time, here the right to cancel is restricted by requirements of good faith reasons for cancellation as well as giving reasonable notice.\n\n",

The measure of Jenny's damages is the amount she reasonably paid for a substitute performance, less the amount saved as a consequence of the breach; i.e., the $\\$ 12,000$ paid to Flusher minus the $\\$ 10,000$ not paid to Plunger, or $\\$ 2,000$. (A) is incorrect because Jenny has not yet paid Plunger anything and has only suffered $\\$ 2,000$ in damages. Jenny, therefore, is only entitled to the measure of damages described above. (C) is incorrect because it is irrelevant that Jenny paid a reasonable price for the substitute performance. In the absence of awareness on her part of Plunger's mistake, which is not indicated here, she was entitled to have the work done for the contract price, or to receive damages for the difference between the contract price and the cost of the substitute performance. (D) is incorrect because Jenny is entitled to relief even if she did not \"accept\" Plunger's bid, because she detrimentally relied on it by using it in her bid.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nThe state of Petrolia derived most of its income from extractive industries, especially its extensive oil and natural gas fields. However, a worldwide drop in the price of petroleum was severe enough to cause a depression in Petrolia, and the state's unemployment rate soared. To counter the effect the depression was having on Petrolia's citizens, the state legislature passed a law requiring all employers operating in the state's oil and natural gas fields to give preference in hiring to residents of Petrolia. The bill banned the hiring of nonresidents unless no other qualified person could be found to fill an oilfield or natural gas field position. Under prevailing economic conditions, the statute was tantamount to a total ban on hiring of nonresidents because so many unemployed oil and gas workers had been created by the depression and little new exploration was taking place.\n\n\"Roughnecks,\" as oilfield workers call themselves, tend to be an itinerant lot, moving from place to place as new fields are brought into production. Driller was a 48-year-old roughneck whose permanent residence was in Louisiana. He had worked on offshore rigs in the Gulf waters off his home state, but Driller had also worked in Texas, Oklahoma, Alaska, Kuwait, Indonesia, and Venezuela. Upon hearing that one of the few independent companies actively exploring in Petrolia had struck a new field in that state, Driller drove to the field office of Ewing Exploration Company in Petrolia and applied for a job. Looking at Driller's extensive experience as described on Driller's resume, Ewing's personnel officer sadly shook his head. He indicated that Driller's qualifications were better than anyone's working in the field, but that he had more applications from experienced Petrolia residents than he had jobs to offer. The sole reason given for not hiring Driller was the preferential hiring statute favoring state residents. Driller filed suit in federal district court challenging the statute.\n\nThe court should rule in favor of:\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Petrolia, because employment discrimina- tion is only unconstitutional if it involves race, religion, alienage, or sex.\n\n(B) Petrolia, because the state's interest in hiring local residents outweighs the interest of nonresidents.\n\n(C) Driller, because the law denies him the privileges and immunities of state citizenship.\n\n(D) Driller, because the preferential hiring law impairs Driller's rights under the Contract Clause of the federal Constitution.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Betsy will prevail because complete destruction of the dictionary results in avoidance of the contract and discharge of her duty to pay, since Stan still had the risk of loss. Since the contract here is for the sale of goods, it is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (\"U.C.C.\"). Under the U.C.C., if a contract requires for its performance particular goods identified when the contract is made, and, before risk of loss passes to the buyer, the goods are destroyed without the fault of either party, the contract is avoided. [U.C.C. \u00a72-613] All of the elements of section 2-613 are present here. The contract required Stan's particular dictionary, which was identified at the time the contract was made. The risk of loss had not yet passed to Betsy because in a sale by a nonmerchant such as Stan, risk of loss does not pass to the buyer until tender [U.C.C. \u00a72-509], and Stan never tendered the dictionary here (there was no actual tender and delivery was not due until April 20). Finally, the fire was caused by Hugh's careless smoking, and so the goods were destroyed without the fault of either party. Thus, the contract is avoided. (The same conclusion would result under the common law doctrine of impossibility-all executory duties are discharged when the subsequent destruction of the subject matter of a contract renders performance impossible.) (A) is incorrect because the U.C.C. contains no such rule. The only U.C.C. remedy that depends on an injured party's insurance involves the risk of loss after the buyer's revocation of acceptance or wrongful repudiation under section 2-510. Here, Betsy does not have to pay because the destruction of the dictionary discharged her duty to do so. (C) is wrong because, as explained above, the risk of loss had not yet passed to Betsy. (D) is wrong because the U.C.C. does not follow the doctrine of equitable conversion; rather, the Code contains very specific risk of loss rules, as detailed above.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Bluto will not be liable to Olive because Bluto's duty to purchase ads was excused by Popeye's failure to use Bluto's repair shop exclusively. The facts indicate that Popeye and Bluto entered into a valid contract that required Bluto to render some performance to Olive. Olive is an intended third-party beneficiary because (i) she was expressly designated in the contract, (ii) some performance is to be made directly to her, and (iii) she stands in such a relationship to the promisee (she is Popeye's wife) that an intent to benefit her can be inferred. She can enforce the contract because her rights have vested; she has materially changed position in justifiable reliance on the promise by turning down work from two prospective clients because of the time Bluto's ads would take. However, when the third-party beneficiary sues the promisor on the contract, the promisor may assert any defenses to formation or performance that he would have been able to assert against the promisee, including failure of a condition. Bluto's promise to perform by placing all of his ads with Olive during the term of the agreement was dependent on the condition that Popeye have all of his buses repaired by Bluto. The failure of Popeye to fulfill this condition excused Bluto's duty to continue to place ads with Olive, and Bluto will be able to assert this defense to performance against Olive. (A) is incorrect because Olive's partial performance does not create a duty for Bluto to continue placing the ads. Bluto's duty is also dependent on performance by Popeye. (B) is incorrect because Olive's detrimental reliance only establishes that her rights in the contract have vested. Thus, she can bring a contract action against Bluto, but Bluto will have a defense. (C) is incorrect because a third party can acquire rights in a contract as an intended beneficiary even though she provided no consideration. The fact that Olive may be a donee beneficiary would not prevent her from enforcing the contract.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Because Olive's rights as a beneficiary had not vested, Popeye and Bluto had a right to modify their agreement without her permission. A contract that benefits a third party may confer rights on that party if she is an intended beneficiary rather than merely an incidental beneficiary. Olive is an intended beneficiary of the agreement between Popeye and Bluto because (i) she was expressly designated in the contract, (ii) some performance is to be made directly to her, and (iii) she stands in a close relationship to the promisee (Popeye), suggesting that he intended for her to benefit. However, an intended beneficiary can enforce the contract only after her rights have vested. Vesting will occur when the beneficiary (i) manifests assent to the promise in a manner invited or requested by the parties, (ii) brings suit to enforce the promise, or (iii) materially changes position in justifiable reliance on the promise. In contrast to the facts in the previous question, the facts for this question do not indicate any action on Olive's part that would have caused her rights to vest before the change in the contract extinguished her rights. (A) is incorrect even though it is a true statement. An intended beneficiary can enforce the contract only after her rights have vested, and here Olive's rights had not vested. $(\\mathrm{B})$ is incorrect because Olive had no contract with Bluto. Any rights that she had were through the contract between Popeye and Bluto. (D) is incorrect. Olive can be classified as a donee beneficiary because the promisee (Popeye) is gratuitously conferring a benefit on the third party (Olive). However, a donee beneficiary is still an intended beneficiary under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts section 302. Had Olive's rights in the contract vested before they were extinguished, her divorce from Popeye would not have prevented her from enforcing the contract.\n\n",

Many Patchquilt residents were on welfare, and the town contained no major industry or shopping district to bolster its tax base. Patchquilt employed only three refuse collectors and asserted reasonably that it could not afford to hire more. However, during the warmest times of the year, extra refuse collections were routine because of the city council's fear that rotting garbage in the hot climate could contribute to the spread of disease. During the hottest months, the three refuse collectors in Patchquilt regularly worked well beyond the 40 hours per week standard.

        "Explanation": " Bill can sue only Moran for breach. The effect of a valid assignment of contract rights is to establish privity of contract between the obligor and the assignee while extinguishing privity between the obligor and assignor. The assignee then replaces the assignor as the real party in interest and he alone is entitled to performance under the contract. As the real party in interest, he may enforce his rights against the obligor directly. Here, Alice (the assignor) has assigned to Bill (the assignee) the right to receive the performance of the contract by Moran (the obligor). Because Moran has materially breached the contract by departing from the specifications and using a cheaper paneling, Bill can sue Moran for breach. (A) and (D) are incorrect because Bill has no grounds for suing Alice (the assignor). The assignor does not guarantee that the obligor will perform the contract for the assignee. The assignor only warrants that she will not wrongfully exercise her power to revoke the assignment and that the obligor does not have any defenses against the assignor unknown to the assignee that can be successfully asserted if the assignee seeks to enforce the obligation. Here, Alice did not try to revoke the assignment and Moran does not appear to have any defenses against Alice. Thus, Bill cannot sue Alice. (C) is incorrect because Nicholls has no duties under the contract; he just has the right to receive payment. Unless a contrary intention appears, courts will construe language assigning \"the contract\" as including an assumption of the duties by the assignee. Here, however, Moran assigned only his right to payment to Nicholls and continued to perform the duties under the contract himself. Thus, no delegation of duties will be implied and Nicholls cannot be sued for breach. \n\n",

        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": " Alice will have to pay Nicholls because she remains liable on the contract. This question builds on the previous question by adding delegation of duty issues to the assignment of rights analysis. A transfer of contractual duties to a third party is called a \"delegation\" of duties. However, the party delegating her duties (the delegator-obligor) remains liable on her contract, even if the third person (the delegate) expressly assumes the duties (i.e., promises that he will perform the duties delegated). When the delegate promises that he will perform the duty delegated and the promise is supported by consideration or its equivalent, an assumption occurs; the nondelegating party (Nicholls) becomes a third-party beneficiary of the assumption agreement and can sue either the delegate who assumed the duty (Bill) or the delegator who remains liable on the contract (Alice). As between those two, the delegate is the principal and the delegator is the surety-if the delegator were sued on the contract, she could obtain reimbursement from the delegate based on the assumption agreement. In this case, therefore, Alice (the delegator-obligor) is still liable on the contract even though she delegated to Bill her duty to pay for the remodeling. On the other side of the contract, Nicholls is the assignee of Moran's right to payment under the contract and therefore can seek enforcement of the contract directly against Alice. (A) is incorrect because a clause prohibiting assignment of \"the contract\" is generally construed as barring only the delegation of the assignor's duties, not the right to receive payment from the obligor; thus, a general prohibition on assignments would not prevent Nicholls from recovering against Alice. Furthermore, a provision in a contract stating specifically that contractual rights may not be assigned is usually ineffective. In other words, the assignor retains the power to assign even though he may be liable for breach of contract, and the assignee may enforce the contract. Thus, the existence of a nonassignment clause in the contract between Alice and Moran would not have deprived Moran of the power to assign his rights to Nicholls. (C) is incorrect because, as discussed above, one who delegates her duties under a contract remains liable on the contract. (D) is wrong because the breach by Moran would be considered a minor breach and would not relieve either Bill or Alice of their duty to pay. A breach of contract is minor if the obligee gains the substantial benefit of her bargain despite the obligor's defective performance. While the aggrieved party may have a right to any provable damages for the breach, she is not relieved of her duty of performance under the contract. To reach this result, the court may treat the paneling specification only as a promise by Moran and not as a condition to Bill and Alice's duty to pay. Alternatively, if complying with the paneling specification is considered a condition to the duty to pay, the court will excuse the condition under the doctrine of substantial performance, which is particularly applicable to construction contracts. Excuse of the condition makes Alice's duty to pay absolute. Since the two imported hardwoods are virtually identical and used interchangeably in the construction industry, Moran has substantially performed under the contract and his breach of contract will be considered minor. Hence, Alice will be liable to pay him for the work.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Because Trendee accepted delivery of the 40 swimsuits, which was Stingray's counteroffer to Trendee's initial order, a contract was created for the 40 suits at $\\$ 10$ each. As a general rule, advertisements, catalogs, and other price quotations are construed as invitations for offers rather than offers. If the language of the catalog could be construed as a definite promise to specific offerees, a court might construe it as an offer, but there is no evidence in this question for such an interpretation. Trendee's order is therefore an offer to purchase 100 swimsuits; because goods are involved, U.C.C. Article 2 applies. Under U.C.C. section 2-206(1)(b), an offer to buy goods for prompt shipment is construed as inviting acceptance either by a promise to ship or by prompt shipment of conforming or nonconforming goods. In this case, Stingray shipped goods that did not conform to the quantity term of Trendee's offer. The Code provides that the shipment of nonconforming goods amounts to both an acceptance of the offer and a breach of the newly formed contract unless the shipper precedes or accompanies the shipment with notice that it is offered as an accommodation. Here, Stingray notified Trendee at the time of its shipment that it would not be able to satisfy the balance of Trendee's order this season. This accommodation notice makes Stingray's shipment a counteroffer, which Trendee accepted by taking delivery and beginning to sell the swimsuits. Stingray is therefore entitled to $\\$ 400$, the price specified by the counteroffer. (B) is incorrect because Stingray's shipment of the 40 swimsuits was not a breach of contract. Had Stingray failed to notify Trendee that its shipment was an accommodation, however, the shipment would have been a nonconforming acceptance and a breach of the contract, entitling Trendee to deduct its cover damages from what it owes Stingray. [U.C.C. \u00a72-711] (C) is incorrect because Stingray is entitled to recover the price it specified in its notice of accommodation (which had made Stingray's shipment a counteroffer).

        "Explanation": " An enforceable contract exists between WidgeCo and Distrucorp, but it does not include the limitation of liability added by Distrucorp's president. At common law, any different or additional terms in an acceptance of an offer made the response a rejection and counteroffer. In contracts for the sale of goods, however, U.C.C. section 2-207 substantially alters the common law rule. The proposal of additional terms by the offeree in a definite and timely acceptance does not constitute a rejection and counteroffer. Rather, the acceptance is effective unless it is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional terms. If both parties to the sale of goods contract are merchants, the additional terms will become part of the contract unless (i) they materially alter the contract, (ii) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer, or (iii) the offeror has already objected to the particular terms, or he objects within a reasonable time after notice of them is received. Here, a sale of goods contract is involved and both parties are merchants. Distrucorp accepted WidgeCo's offer by mailing back a standard printed acceptance form, even though the form contained an additional limitation of liability term added by Distrucorp's president. This limitation of liability provision did not become part of the contract, however, because it would have substantially changed the allocation of economic risks and benefits and impaired an otherwise available remedy. Hence, a valid contract exists between the parties but it is limited to the terms of WidgeCo's offer. (A) is incorrect because the material alteration by Distrucorp does not prevent formation of the contract under section 2-207, but the term that produces the material alteration will not be a part of the contract. (C) is incorrect. The additional term does not become part of the contract, even though WidgeCo raised no objection to it, because it materially altered the contract. An additional term will only become part of the contract if it is not a material alteration and if the offeror does not object to it within a reasonable time. Hence, WidgeCo's failure to object did not cause the term to be included in the contract. (D) is incorrect because under section 2-207, Distrucorp's response to WidgeCo was an acceptance rather than a counteroffer. For the response to have been a counteroffer rather than an acceptance, it would have had to expressly condition acceptance upon WidgeCo's assent to the additional term. \n\n",

The constitution of State Green provides that the state supreme court may hand down declaratory judgments, and the question of the bill's constitutionality was brought before the state supreme court. The court ruled that the bill, in the form it was introduced into the legislature, is constitutional.\n\nThere is only one plutonium processing plant in State Green. It is owned and operated by Master Minerals Corporation. The plant operates under contract with the federal government and is highly profitable for Master Minerals. Master Minerals seeks to have the judgment of the state supreme court overturned, and its attorneys have filed appropriate papers to bring the case before the United States Supreme Court.\n\nThe Court should:\n",

        "Explanation": " A contract was formed for $\\$ 10,000$ because the oral modification is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds. Under the U.C.C., a contract for the sale of goods priced at $\\$ 500$ or more is not enforceable unless evidenced by a writing. Furthermore, contract modifications must also meet the Statute of Frauds requirement if the contract as modified is within the Statute's provisions. Here, the Statute of Frauds is applicable to both the original contract and the contract as modified. Since the modification was not in writing, it is not enforceable; hence, the terms of the original contract, which satisfies Statute of Frauds requirements, are effective. (A) is wrong even though Tekmart did accept before October 31 and no additional consideration was needed for the oral modification. Because the Statute of Frauds is applicable to the modification, the $1 \\%$ discount is not effective. (B) is wrong because the parol evidence rule is applicable only to oral expressions made prior to or contemporaneous with the written contract; parol evidence can be offered to show subsequent modifications of a written contract. Since the contract was created when Tekmart dispatched the letter (as discussed below), the agreement regarding the $1 \\%$ discount is a subsequent modification and therefore unaffected by the parol evidence rule. (D) is incorrect because the mailbox rule is applicable to the facts here; the acceptance was effective on dispatch. If Tekmart had sent its rejection before its acceptance, the mailbox rule would not apply and the rejection would take effect because it arrived before the acceptance. However, since Tekmart sent its acceptance first and then its rejection, and Megabyte did not change its position in reliance on the rejection, the mailbox rule is applicable and the acceptance was effective when it was sent.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Tommy cannot enforce Dad's promise on either contractual or promissory estoppel grounds. An enforceable contract does not exist because there was no consideration for Dad's promise to send $\\$ 1,000$. Tommy, the promisee, incurred no legal detriment by either refraining from doing something that he had a legal right to do or doing something that he had no legal obligation to do, with such detriment being part of a bargained-for exchange with Dad. However, consideration is not necessary if the promisor should be estopped from not performing. A promise is enforceable to the extent necessary to prevent injustice if: (i) the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance; (ii) of a definite and substantial character; and (iii) such action or forbearance is induced. Dad had previously sent Tommy money for his expenses, and promised to send him the money here at issue for the same purpose. Due to Dad's express disapproval of Gidget, Dad certainly did not promise to send the money expecting to induce Tommy to buy Gidget a ring. Dad cannot be estopped from refusing to perform a promise where the result would be to require him to pay for something that he not only was unaware would happen but also of which he expressly disapproved. Thus, Dad's promise is not enforceable under a theory of promissory estoppel. (A) is incorrect because, although Tommy relied on Dad's promise in entering into the contract to purchase the ring, the promise was only made with the expectation of Tommy's incurring normal living expenses. Thus, Tommy was not justified in relying on the promise for the purpose that he did, and promissory estoppel does not apply. (B) is incorrect because the term \"intended beneficiary\" refers to a person not a party to a contract who is intended to have rights conferred by that contract. Here, there was no contract between Dad and someone else, pursuant to which Tommy became entitled to the money. (C) is not as good an answer as (D). It is true that Dad's promise was a gift unsupported by consideration. However, if circumstances existed justifying the application of promissory estoppel, the promise would be enforceable even in the absence of consideration. Therefore, (C) is not as precise as (D). \n\n",

Bob, decided that the state legislature would serve as an effective pulpit for his religious views by giving him a great deal of media exposure and direct mail resources. The state of Plains had no provision barring members of the clergy from serving as legislators. Bob entered a race that already had several other candidates and took advantage of the state's liberal voter registration laws by having many of his followers move into the district a month before the election. Bob's subsequent victory in the race shocked the political establishment and prompted a citizens' group to file a lawsuit in federal district court.

        "Explanation": " The court should rule that there was sufficient consideration in Ellen's promise since her agreement to use her best efforts to sell and promote Calvin's gowns will be implied. For a contract to be valid, consideration must exist on both sides; i.e., promises must be mutually obligatory. Here, Calvin has agreed to make Ellen his exclusive retail distributor, but Ellen's promise is less apparent-what is she obliged to do? The facts do not show any specific obligation. However, in a case where someone is to be the exclusive distributor, the court will imply a promise to use best efforts to sell the product. This implied promise is valid consideration both under the common law and the Uniform Commercial Code (applicable here because goods are involved). Thus, the contract between Ellen and Calvin includes an implied promise that Ellen will use her best efforts to promote and sell Calvin's gowns, and such a promise is valid consideration. (A) is wrong because merely placing an order for gowns would not cure the defect in the April 1 contract absent Ellen's implied promise, because Ellen still will not have promised to do anything under that contract (i.e., she is not bound to do anything referable to the April 1 contract); rather, all she has promised to do is to pay for the goods that she ordered, which is sufficient consideration only for the May 1 order, not for the entire contract. (B) is wrong because a merchant's firm offer must contain words promising to keep the offer open for a period of time, and here the contract explicitly states that it may be canceled at any time. (D) is wrong because as in (A), Calvin's act here is not necessarily referable to the April 1 contract; rather, it is important only as to the May 1 order; it does not settle the issue of whether there was an enforceable April 1 contract. \n\n$$\n\\text { . }\n$$\n\n\n\n",

Babe was touched by Jimmy's will to live despite a very poor prognosis. In a moment of weakness, Babe told Jimmy that in consideration of Jimmy's courage, he would do anything that Jimmy asked. Jimmy's eyes momentarily gleamed as he asked Babe to \"hit a homer for me in your next game.\" Babe replied, \"Sure kid.\" As Babe was leaving Jimmy's hospital room, Jimmy's father, Joe, pulled Babe aside and told Babe, \"It would mean a lot to Jimmy if you would hit a home run for him in your next game.

        "Explanation": " Dorothy is liable both for the attempted murder of Melissa and, under the doctrine of transferred intent, for the murder of Hank. To be guilty of murder, one must unlawfully kill another human being with malice aforethought, which is a term of art encompassing various states of mind, including intent to kill, and the absence of facts excusing the homicide or reducing it to voluntary manslaughter. Here, Dorothy had the intent to kill Melissa. Under the doctrine of transferred intent, this intent is transferred from Melissa to Hank, the actual victim of the murder. There are no facts here excusing the homicide or reducing it to voluntary manslaughter on the basis of adequate provocation. Modern courts might allow a jury to consider whether discovery of the love letters would arouse the intense passion required for the first element of the provocation test; however, the third element, an absence of sufficient time between the provocation and the killing for the passions of a reasonable person to have cooled, is disproved by the facts of the question. The act of killing, although done by Sammy, is attributable to Dorothy as the principal because she caused an innocent intermediary (Sammy) to accomplish the result. Hence, Dorothy is liable for the murder of Hank; (C) is therefore incorrect. At common law, the crime of attempted murder required both a specific intent by the actor to kill the victim and an act that puts the defendant in close proximity to completing the crime. The Model Penal Code and most state criminal codes modify the \"proximity\" test for the act requirement, instead requiring an act that constitutes a \"substantial step\" towards commission of the crime. Here, Dorothy had the intent to kill Melissa and intentionally gave the loaded gun to Sammy with instructions to point it at Melissa and pull the trigger. Under either of the tests used, her conduct satisfies the act requirement of attempt. Thus, Dorothy is also liable for the attempted murder of Melissa; (B) is therefore incorrect. (D) is incorrect because the same act and intent can constitute both an attempt as to one person and a completed crime as to another person. Although, if Sammy's aim had been better, Dorothy could not have been convicted of both attempted murder of Melissa and murder of Melissa, the attempt against Melissa and the murder of Hank are separate crimes because more than one victim is involved.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Howard can be convicted of murder. Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought, which may be (i) intent to kill, (ii) intent to inflict great bodily injury, (iii) reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life, or (iv) intent to commit a felony. Intentional use of a deadly weapon authorizes a permissive inference of intent to kill. Here, Howard uttered statements of revenge, confronted Nick with a loaded gun, and intentionally shot him when he pulled out a knife-more than enough evidence for a jury to find that Howard had the malice aforethought necessary for murder. Furthermore, none of the issues raised in the other choices will suffice to excuse the killing or reduce it to voluntary manslaughter. (B) is wrong because Howard will not be able to meet all four tests for establishing the provocation necessary to reduce a killing from murder to voluntary manslaughter. Howard would have to offer evidence that (i) a provocation existed that would arouse sudden and intense passion in the mind of an ordinary person such as to cause him to lose his self-control, (ii) Howard was in fact provoked and lost his self-control, (iii) there was not sufficient time between the provocation and the killing for the passions of a reasonable person to cool, and (iv) Howard in fact did not cool off between the provocation and the killing. Howard can easily establish the first two elements, because discovery of one's spouse in bed with another person is virtually always considered adequate provocation by common law courts. However, the time interval between the provocation and the killing was probably sufficient for a reasonable person to cool off, and the facts 100. CRIMINAL LAW\n\nstrongly suggest that Howard did in fact cool off-.he consumed several drinks to build up his nerve before setting off for Nick's house, and he did not shoot Nick immediately when he confronted him. Thus, a jury would probably reject a claim of voluntary manslaughter here. (C) is incorrect because Howard's voluntary intoxication would not preclude a finding of intent for murder. Because Howard became intoxicated to build up his nerve to kill Nick, a court would probably find that his intent at the time he began drinking would apply to his later conduct. Furthermore, voluntary intoxication is no defense to crimes involving recklessness. Howard can still be liable for murder based on a state of mind of reckless indifference to human life-his conduct in becoming intoxicated and then confronting Nick with a loaded gun is sufficient to establish that state of mind. (D) is incorrect because the homicide will not be excused on selfdefense grounds. A person may use deadly force in self-defense only if (i) he is without fault, (ii) he is confronted with unlawful force, and (iii) he is threatened with imminent death or great bodily harm. Howard is not without fault, however, because he initiated the assault and prompted Nick to pull the knife. His status as the aggressor deprives him of the right to use force in his own defense under these circumstances.\n\n",

During this time, it annually sent to chief executives of area businesses personalized \"invitations\" to lease skyboxes for the season. The invitations, which were always sent out several months before each season began, contained detailed price terms and language stating that the deadline for responding was 10 weeks before the start of the season and that all leases were subject to the approval of the management of United Leasing. Executives at Multimedia Marketing had always responded to their invitation immediately by registered mail because they found it very worthwhile to lease a skybox to entertain their clients.

        "Explanation": " The court should affirm Larry's conviction. Crimes imposing a mens rea of malice generally do not require the proof of intent that specific intent crimes require. It is sufficient if the defendant recklessly disregarded an obvious or high risk that the particular harmful result would occur. Here, the facts presented were sufficient to allow the jury to conclude that Larry knew of the probability that the ladder would collapse without the braces when someone climbed down it, and acted in reckless disregard of that risk by removing the braces. (A) is incorrect because the fact that Larry was committing larceny when he removed the braces does not establish malice for purposes of the malicious injury charge. Even if his conduct were otherwise legal, he could be liable for that charge if he acted with reckless disregard of the high risk of injury. (C) is wrong because, as discussed above, it is generally not necessary to show an intent to injure for a crime requiring a mens rea of malice; reckless disregard of an obvious risk will usually suffice. (D) is incorrect because crimes requiring a mens rea of malice do not refer to malice in the dictionary sense; a showing of ill will or hatred of the victim is not required.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Dana can be convicted of first degree murder for Victor's death. Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. In the absence of facts excusing the homicide or reducing it to voluntary manslaughter, malice aforethought exists if the defendant has (i) intent to kill, (ii) intent to inflict great bodily injury, (iii) awareness of an unjustifiably high risk to human life, or (iv) intent to commit a felony (felony murder doctrine). In this case Dana clearly had the intent to kill Victor; her motive for doing so is irrelevant for establishing malice aforethought. It is also quite possible under the facts that Dana acted with premeditation and deliberation, making her potentially liable for first degree murder. \"Deliberate\" means that the defendant reflected on the crime in a cool and dispassionate manner. \"Premeditated\" means that such reflection actually was undertaken, but it need only be for a very brief period. Here, Dana could have reflected on the crime before she visited the hospital; the fact that she had a gun in her purse is circumstantial evidence of such reflection. Even if she did not make the decision to kill until moments before she pulled out the gun, she would still have been capable of premeditation and deliberation. (B) is therefore incorrect because it is not the most serious crime of which Dana can be convicted. (C) is incorrect because of the absence of facts establishing adequate provocation that would reduce an intentional killing from murder to voluntary manslaughter. Adequate provocation is most frequently recognized in cases of (i) being subjected to a serious battery or threat of deadly force, and (ii) discovering one's spouse in bed with another person. While modern courts have broadened somewhat the scope of what constitutes provocation, the law does not presently recognize feelings of mercy toward the victim as an adequate provocation. Thus, Dana can be convicted of murder for Victor's death.

The oven had been manufactured in Belgium in 1937, but the plant that manufactured the oven was destroyed by bombing during World War II, and no more of the ovens were produced after 1940 . It would be difficult and expensive to find a suitable substitute, and when the oven malfunctioned, replacement parts were extremely difficult to find and very costly as well.

        "Explanation": " Dewey is least likely to be found guilty of an attempt crime because the act he committed is not a crime in the jurisdiction. The general rule is that a defendant cannot avoid liability for attempt on the basis that it would have been impossible to commit the completed crime. It applies to cases where the defendant's mistaken belief about the facts (i.e., factual impossibility) or about the legal relationships or circumstances prevents him from completing the crime that he intended to commit. However, it is still necessary that the result desired or intended by the defendant constitute a crime. Even if he otherwise has the kind of culpability required for the completed crime, his objective must be proscribed by law. If those things the defendant does or intends to do would not actually be a crime, this is legal impossibility and a defense. The defendant will not be guilty of an attempt even though he firmly believed that his goal was criminal. The facts in (B) indicate that Dewey thought he was committing statutory rape, but in fact the conduct he engaged in, and intended to engage in, was not proscribed by law. Thus, his conduct does not constitute an attempt to commit statutory rape. (A) is incorrect because Don's mistake about the legal status of the goods he fenced does not constitute a defense to attempt. The jewelry in the fact pattern in (A) has lost its status as \"stolen\" jewelry because it is being forwarded to Don with the owners' permission; it is therefore impossible for him to be liable for the completed crime of receipt of stolen goods. However, Don is guilty of attempted receipt of stolen goods because the legal status of the goods, unlike the existence or nonexistence of a law proscribing the conduct, is one of the attendant circumstances; this is treated like factual impossibility by most courts. By accepting the goods he believes to be stolen, Don has purposely engaged in conduct that would constitute receipt of stolen goods if the circumstances were as he believed them to be; hence, he is liable for attempted receipt of stolen goods. (C) is incorrect because Doreen has intentionally engaged in conduct that constitutes an attempt to conduct an illegal demonstration. The issue in this situation is mistake of law rather than impossibility. The general rule is that it is no defense to a crime that the defendant mistakenly believed that her acts were not prohibited by law. This is true even if her mistake was reasonable or was based upon advice of private counsel. Nor will mistake of law negate intent unless the mental state for a crime requires a certain belief concerning a collateral aspect of law, which is not the case here. There is no indication that the statute prohibiting illegal demonstrations requires knowledge that the demonstration is illegal. Had Doreen actually begun demonstrating in the building, she would have been liable for the completed crime simply because she had the intent to conduct the demonstration. Doreen is liable under the state's attempt statute because, acting with the intent to conduct a demonstration that would be illegal, she purposely attempted to bring her picket sign into the capitol building; this constituted an act in close proximity to completion of the crime. (D) is incorrect because Drew cannot defend on the ground that the completed crime was factually impossible to commit. The crime of theft by false pretenses requires that the defendant obtain title to the property of another by an intentional false statement of past or existing fact. This indicates that the false statement must be the cause of the victim passing title to the defendant (i.e., the victim must rely on the statement). Because Hartigan was just disguising himself as a homeowner as part of the sting operation, it would have been impossible for Drew to commit the completed offense. However, Drew had the intent to commit the crime and purposely did everything necessary to complete the crime had the facts been as he believed them to be. As a result, Drew is liable for attempted theft by false pretenses.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " The state's best argument is that, because Gordon was not a government agent, he need not have given Denise the Miranda warnings. As a means of protecting the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination, a person must be informed prior to custodial interrogation that: (i) she has the right to remain silent; (ii) anything she says can be used against her in court; (iii) she has the right to the presence of an attorney; and (iv) if she cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for her if she so desires. These Miranda warnings must be given only if the detainee is being questioned by someone known to be working for the police. Here, Gordon is a private security guard employed by a private business (the grocery store). Thus, since Gordon was not required to inform Denise of the Miranda warnings, he could not possibly have violated Denise's Miranda rights. (A), (B), and (C) all reflect matters that would come into play only if Gordon were a government agent. However, they would also be incorrect even if Gordon were a government agent. (A) is incorrect because Gordon's statement might be deemed to be interrogatory. \"Interrogation\" refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police that they should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect. Although it is not an express question to say \"You're too young to be a thief,\" such words are reasonably likely to bring forth some sort of incriminating response. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that Gordon's statement was not interrogatory. (B) is incorrect because, in a delinquency proceeding, a juvenile must be afforded the right not to testify, including all aspects of the privilege against self-incrimination.

        "Explanation": " The cocaine is inadmissible because it is the product of an unconstitutional search of Nick. The Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures applies to an investigatory detention and any type of search during the detention. Under Terry $v$. Ohio (1968), police have the authority to briefly detain a person for investigative purposes, even if they lack probable cause to arrest, as long as they have an articulable and reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. However, an investigatory detention does not create the right to search the person being detained. The officer may conduct a protective frisk (a patdown of the outer clothing) only if he reasonably believes that the person may be armed and presently dangerous. A full search of the person is only permitted if the detention establishes probable cause for a lawful arrest. In this case, Sam may have had sufficient grounds to detain Mike and Nick to ask them questions. Whether police have a reasonable suspicion-supported by articulable facts-of criminal activity is judged by the totality of the circumstances. [United States v. Sokolow (1989)] Here, the conduct of Mike and Nick may have made Sam reasonably suspicious that they were smuggling drugs. However, after finding nothing in his search of their luggage, and having no reason to believe that they were armed and presently dangerous, Sam had neither probable cause nor reasonable suspicion to either search or frisk Mike and Nick. Hence, under the exclusionary rule, the cocaine obtained as a result of the unlawful search of Nick is inadmissible against him. (A) is incorrect because there is no general emergency exception justifying searches without probable cause, and the search at issue here had none of the exigent circumstances that the Supreme Court has relied on in prior cases to permit warrantless searches (such as the hot pursuit of a fleeing felon or the evanescent nature of the evidence). (B) is incorrect because the scope of a search permitted by consent is limited by the scope of the consent. Nick's consent to the search of his luggage created no implication of a consent to a body search. (D) is incorrect because Sam had Mike and Nick's consent to search their luggage. Police may conduct a valid and warrantless search if they have a voluntary and intelligent consent to do so from the individual being searched; Mike and Nick's consent here satisfies these requirements.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Because Mike's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated by the unlawful search of Nick, the cocaine may be introduced against Mike at trial. Under Rakas v. Illinois (1978), Fourth Amendment rights may be enforced by the exclusion of evidence only at the instance of one whose own protection was infringed by the search and seizure. Ownership of the property seized does not automatically establish violation of one's reasonable expectation of privacy; it is just one factor in the totality of the circumstances that the court will consider. [Rawlings v. Kentucky (1980)] Here, the cocaine was seized from Nick as a result of a search that violated his Fourth Amendment rights. However, nothing in the question indicates that Mike had a legitimate expectation of privacy in Nick's body (such as the right to exclude others from searching Nick if Nick had consented). Under the circumstances in this case, Mike's ownership of the cocaine does not establish a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to the search of Nick. (A) is incorrect because the fact that Mike did not have actual possession of the cocaine does not require that the cocaine be excluded from his trial. He may be liable under the jurisdiction's possession statute if he had sufficient dominion or control over the cocaine to be in constructive possession of it. (B) is incorrect even though it is a true statement. Sam's search of Mike violated Mike's reasonable expectation of privacy, but no evidence was obtained by the illegal search of Mike. Sam's search of Nick violated Nick's reasonable expectation of privacy but not Mike's expectation of privacy (as discussed above). Because Mike's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated by the search of Nick, he cannot use the exclusionary rule to suppress introduction of the cocaine. (C) is incorrect because the defendant has the right to testify and stipulate to facts at a preliminary hearing on a motion to suppress the evidence without his testimony or stipulation being admitted against him at trial on the issue of guilt. [Simmons v. United States (1968)] This rule allows a defendant to assert a possessory or ownership interest in illegally seized evidence just for purposes of invoking the exclusionary rule; if he fails to have the evidence excluded, he may still deny possession or ownership at trial.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Statement III. offers Simpson the only basis for vacating his guilty plea and sentence. In accordance with the contractual view of plea bargains, a defendant who agrees to a plea bargain has the right to have that bargain kept. If the prosecution does not keep the bargain, the court will decide whether the circumstances require specific performance of the plea agreement or whether the defendant should be granted an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea. Here, Simpson agreed to testify against his co-defendants in exchange for the recommendation of probation. His co-defendants' decision to plead guilty rather than go to trial may have been influenced by the fact that Simpson had agreed to testify; hence, the fact that he did not testify at their trial does not allow the prosecution to avoid the terms of the plea bargain. (A) and (B) are wrong because the fact that the prosecution threatened to bring additional charges, as indicated in Statement I., is not a basis for claiming that a guilty plea was involuntary as long as there was some legal basis for bringing the additional charges. Consistent with the contract theory of plea negotiation, the State has the power to drive a hard bargain in reaching a plea agreement. (B) and (C) are wrong because Simpson's claim of innocence does not prevent the court from accepting his guilty plea, contrary to Statement II. Before accepting a guilty plea, the court must find that the plea was voluntary and intelligent. However, admission of guilt is not a constitutional requisite to imposition of a criminal penalty. When a defendant pleads guilty despite protesting his innocence, the plea may still be seen as an intelligent choice by the defendant, and withdrawal of the plea will not be permitted when there is other strong evidence of guilt in the record. Here, Simpson weighed the risks and benefits before pleading guilty, and the statements by his co-defendants provide other evidence of his guilt; thus, his claim of innocence is not a basis for attacking his guilty plea.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Father White's testimony as to Dassent's responsible nature is admissible as circumstantial evidence that he was not driving the hit-and-run vehicle. The accused in a criminal case can introduce evidence of his good character to show his innocence of the alleged crime. Federal Rule 405 allows the defendant to call a qualified witness to testify as to his personal opinion concerning a trait of the defendant that is involved in the case. In this case, whether Dassent was the driver of the hit-and-run vehicle is a critical issue in the case; thus, testimony that Dassent is a responsible person who would not leave the scene of an accident pertains to a relevant character trait. Father White, having known Dassent for 12 years, is qualified to give his personal opinion as to Dassent's character. The court should therefore permit White to testify. (B) is incorrect because Father White's testimony is character evidence rather than habit evidence. Both habit evidence and character evidence are admissible to show how a person probably acted on a particular occasion. However, habit evidence describes one's regular response to a specific set of circumstances, while character evidence describes one's disposition in respect to general traits. Here, there is no specific repeated situation that Dassent regularly responded to (such as regularly failing to stop at a certain stop sign). Rather, it is Dassent's general trait of responsibility that is being offered as evidence. (C) is incorrect because Father White's testimony is admissible as relevant character evidence. As a general rule, a party may not bolster the testimony of his witness until the witness has been impeached. Here, even though Father White's testimony bolsters Dassent's unimpeached testimony that he did not drive the hit-and-run vehicle, it is independently admissible as character evidence that supports Dassent's case. The fact that Dassent is testifying in his own defense when Father White is called to support him does not make Father White's testimony inadmissible. (D) is incorrect because it reverses the rule. In a criminal case, the defense does not need to have the prosecution put defendant's character in issue before the defense can rebut it; the defense can initiate evidence of the defendant's character. On the other hand, the prosecution cannot make an issue of defendant's character until the defendant has elected to put his character in issue.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Testimony of Devlin's reputation as a violent person is admissible to rebut the defendant's character evidence. The general rule is that the prosecution cannot initiate evidence of the bad character of the defendant merely to show that he is more likely to have committed the crime of which he is accused. However, if the defendant puts his character in issue by having a character witness testify as to his opinion of the defendant, the prosecution may rebut with evidence of the defendant's bad character. One means of rebutting defendant's character evidence is by calling qualified witnesses to testify to the defendant's bad reputation for the particular trait involved in the case. Here, Devlin put his character in issue by having Westin testify to Devlin's nonviolent nature, which is relevant to whether he committed the crime charged. The prosecution, assuming that it can show that the police officer has knowledge of Devlin's reputation in the community, can have the officer testify that Devlin had a reputation as a violent person. (A) is incorrect because Westin's credibility cannot be attacked by extrinsic evidence of specific instances of misconduct. While any matter that tends to prove or disprove the credibility of a witness is relevant for purposes of impeachment, extrinsic evidence of the witness's bad acts is not permitted to attack the witness's character for truthfulness. Unless the misconduct was the basis for a criminal conviction, for which a record of the judgment may be offered, bad acts may only be inquired about during cross-examination.

        "Explanation": " The testimony of Wally is character evidence; i.e., it describes Don's general behavior patterns.

Here, Perry is trying to employ the circumstantial use of prior behavior patterns to draw the inference that Don drove at an excessive rate of speed at the time of the incident here at issue. Such a use of character evidence is not permitted. (A) is incorrect because character is not in issue. An exception to the general prohibition of character evidence is that, when a person's character itself is one of the issues in the case, character evidence is admissible. Don's character as a driver is not in issue; rather, his actions at a specific time and place are in issue. Thus, this exception does not apply to these facts. Regarding (B), it is true that character may be established by reputation evidence under the Federal Rules. However, as explained above, this is not a proper case for the use of character evidence. Therefore, (B) is incorrect. (D) is also incorrect. While it is true that testimony as to a person's reputation in the community may in some sense be considered hearsay (i.e., such testimony reflects what people are saying about a person), reputation testimony is a permissible (and in fact, the most common) means of showing character.

        "Explanation": " The statement by Doug, who is one of the parties to the action, is admissible as an admission of a party-opponent. Federal Rule $801(\\mathrm{~d})(2)$ provides that a statement offered against a party that is the party's own statement is not hearsay and therefore cannot be excluded by the rule against hearsay. Assuming that it is relevant and not barred by other rules, the statement is admissible. Here, Doug's statement is being offered against him at trial. It is relevant because it can be interpreted as a prior acknowledgment by Doug that he was not totally blameless in the accident, which is undoubtedly inconsistent with his contentions at trial. The statement does not violate Federal Rule 408, which makes offers to compromise a disputed claim inadmissible to prove liability for the claim, because it was made by Doug before Peter made any claim; i.e., there was not yet an actual dispute between the parties. Nor does the statement violate Rule 411 , which bars evidence that a person has liability insurance when offered to show fault or ability to pay, because Doug's reference to his insurance was an intrinsic part of his admission and could not be readily severed from it. No other rules barring relevant evidence apply, so the statement should be admitted. (B) is incorrect because the statement against interest exception to the hearsay rule [Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3)] requires the declarant to be unavailable as a witness, which is not indicated here. More importantly, whenever the statement being offered is by a party, it will almost always be admissible as an admission of a party-opponent even though it does not qualify as a statement against interest, because an admission has none of the restrictions that a statement against interest has. (C) is wrong because, as previously noted, Doug's statement was made before the existence of a disputed claim between the parties. The public policy rationale for Rule 408 , which is to encourage settlement of disputes without litigation, does not come into play until litigation is at least threatened. (D) is incorrect because the statement is an admission by a party, which is treated as nonhearsay under the Federal Rules.\n\n",

        "Final Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": " The prosecutor's question was a proper means of impeaching Wendt's credibility. A witness may be impeached through cross-examination by evidence that he is biased or has an interest in the outcome of the case; i.e., evidence that shows that he has a motive to lie. Since Wendt has been indicted for the same armed robbery, it clearly helps his case for him to provide an alibi for both of them. Furthermore, if Wendt were to testify that he and Doobad committed the robbery, his testimony could be used against him at his own trial as an admission. Thus, Wendt has a motive to lie and may be impeached by being asked on cross-examination about the facts that show bias, as the prosecutor did here. (A) is incorrect because the prosecutor is impeaching Wendt on the basis of bias, not on the basis of poor character for truthfulness. For the latter basis of impeachment, Federal Rule 609 requires a criminal conviction rather than just an indictment (unless it was for a crime probative of truthfulness, such as perjury, which could be the subject of crossexamination under Rule 608(b) even if there has not yet been a conviction). Thus, Wendt could not be impeached by being asked about an indictment (and (A) would then be the correct choice) if Wendt had been under indictment for a robbery other than the same robbery for which Doobad is being tried (since it would not show a motive to lie for Doobad). (B) misstates the law. A witness may be impeached by interrogating him as to specific acts of misconduct that may affect his character and show him to be unworthy of belief. [See Fed. R. Evid. 608(b)] (C) is incorrect because evidence is never admissible to show a person's criminal propensities. For impeachment purposes, the prosecution wants to attack the witness's credibility rather than his criminal propensity. The indictment, as opposed to the crime charged in the indictment, generally shows nothing with respect to the witness's character for truthfulness. Thus, to impeach this witness on a ground other than bias, the prosecutor would ask about the robbery itself, not the indictment.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Birch's former testimony should be admissible. Under Federal Rule 804(b)(1), the testimony of a now unavailable witness given at another hearing under oath is admissible in a subsequent trial as long as there is a sufficient similarity of parties and issues so that the opportunity to develop testimony or cross-examine at the prior hearing was meaningful. In criminal cases, the accused or his attorney must have been present and have had the opportunity to cross-examine at the time the testimony was given. Here, Birch's testimony was given against Dogwood at a prosecution for the same conduct that constituted the felony murder offense for which Dogwood is now being prosecuted, and Dogwood had the same motive to challenge Birch's identification of him then as he does now. Hence, the testimony can be admitted under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule. (A) is wrong because it is not essential, even in criminal cases, that the trials be on the same charge. The exception is satisfied as long as the subject matter is sufficiently similar that the defendant had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the declarant's testimony at the prior hearing. (B) is incorrect because the Supreme Court has rejected a Confrontation Clause challenge to the use of former testimony. As long as the defendant had the opportunity to crossexamine at the prior hearing and the witness is truly unavailable, the testimony is admissible. (C) is incorrect because it refers to prior statements of identification by a witness at the present trial. This case involves the hearsay exception for former testimony, which requires that the witness now be unavailable.\n\n",

The car, driven by Doofus, was pulled over to the curb. As Officer Smith issued a speeding citation to Doofus, her partner, Jones, fed the license plate numbers into the police computer. It turned out that the Belchfire had been very recently reported as stolen. Doofus was unable to produce satisfactory registration papers and was arrested for car theft. At the police station, Smith gave Doofus the standard Miranda warnings, and Doofus agreed to answer Smith's questions regarding a local \"chop-shop\" network, which arranged for the theft of expensive automobiles so that they could be cut up for parts. After a while, Jones suggested, \"Let's break for lunch.\" He and Smith escorted Doofus to a nearby cafeteria.

        "Explanation": " Warren's testimony is admissible under the present state of mind exception to the hearsay rule. Under Rule 803(3), a statement of a declarant's then-existing state of mind is admissible as circumstantial evidence tending to show that the intent was carried out. [See Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hillmon (1892)] Here, Vanessa's statement to Warren is being offered to show that she probably went to the store where Trent was working that night, which is a material issue in the case.

        "Explanation": " Phil's testimony is admissible as a statement of past physical condition. As an exception to the hearsay rule, the Federal Rules admit statements of past physical condition if made to medical personnel to assist in diagnosing or treating the condition. [Fed. R. Evid. 803(4)] Here, proper treatment by Phil of Violet's injuries required disclosure of the nature and duration of such injuries. Thus, Violet's statement as to having been beaten, and the time span involving the beatings, is pertinent to her diagnosis and treatment. Rule 803(4) also allows statements of the cause or source of the conditions insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment. In cases of domestic child abuse, courts have held that the identity of the attacker is pertinent for purposes of physical and psychological treatment. Here, Violet's statement that her mother's livein boyfriend was her assailant would qualify under this rule. Consequently, Phil's testimony as to Violet's statement is admissible under this exception to the hearsay rule. (A) is incorrect because the federal courts do not recognize any physician-patient privilege unless they are applying the law of a state recognizing the privilege, and here Darryl is being sued under a federal statute. Hence, no one would have to waive the privilege for Phil to testify. (C) is incorrect because, as explained above, statements as to the cause of a condition, including the identity of the assailant under the circumstances in this case, are admissible under this hearsay exception. (D) is incorrect. Unlike the hearsay exception for statements of family history, the exception for statements of past physical condition does not require that the declarant be unavailable.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " The barograph record is admissible only if it is properly authenticated. Before a writing or any secondary evidence of its content may be received in evidence, the writing must be authenticated by proof showing that the writing is what the proponent says it is. In general, a writing may be authenticated by any evidence that serves to establish its authenticity. One means of authentication under Federal Rule $901(\\mathrm{~b})$ is by evidence describing a process or system used to produce a result and showing that the process or system produces an accurate result. Hence, for Akiro's barograph record to be admissible, evidence must be offered that the instrument is accurate and that it was in good working order when the record was produced. (A) is incorrect because past recollection recorded is inapplicable here. Past recollection recorded is an exception to the hearsay rule that applies when a witness testifying about an event has insufficient recollection of it, even after consulting a writing of the event. The writing itself may be read into evidence if a proper foundation has been laid for its admissibility. Here, no witness is testifying-the barograph record is being offered independent of any testimony. (B) is wrong because the hearsay exception for records of regularly conducted activity applies only to records made in the regular course of a business. Although \"business\" is defined broadly under the Federal Rules to include churches and other not-for-profit organizations, it does not include what Akiro does for a hobby in his backyard. Hence, that hearsay exception is inapplicable. (D) is incorrect because the barograph record is not hearsay. Under the Federal Rules, hearsay is \"a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" A \"statement\" under the Federal Rules is an oral or written assertion or nonverbal conduct by a person intended as an assertion. A machine such as the barograph is not making or intending to make an assertion when it creates a record of an event; hence, the record is not a \"statement\" for purposes of the hearsay rule.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Walter's testimony is admissible only to challenge the credibility of Bob's earlier inconsistent statement. Because the credibility of a hearsay declarant is as much at issue as the credibility of an in-court witness, Federal Rule 806 allows statements of a hearsay declarant to be impeached to the same extent as those of an in-court witness. Thus, a statement of the declarant made at any time that is inconsistent with his hearsay statement may be offered into evidence for impeachment purposes. Here, Bob's hearsay statement (which was admissible as an excited utterance) was testified to by Wilma. Bob's subsequent statement to Walter is inconsistent with his hearsay statement and is therefore admissible to discredit that statement. (B) is wrong because the statement would be hearsay not within any exception if it were offered as substantive evidence. Under Federal Rule 801(d)(1), prior inconsistent statements are only admissible as substantive evidence when they are statements of a witness who is now testifying at trial and were made under oath at a prior trial or deposition. (C) is wrong because the general requirement that an impeached witness be given an opportunity to explain or deny an apparently inconsistent statement does not apply to hearsay declarants. Because hearsay statements are often admissible at trial after the declarant has died or is otherwise unavailable, Rule 806 provides that the declarant need not be given an opportunity to explain or deny statements that are inconsistent with the declarant's hearsay statement.

        "Explanation": " Magnolia has a life estate pur autre vie and can be compelled to pay the property taxes. A life estate is an estate that is not terminable at any fixed or computable period of time, but cannot last longer than the life of a particular person. A life estate pur autre vie (for the life of another) is a life estate measured by the life of someone other than the life tenant. Such an estate will be created when the grantor conveys a life estate to $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{A}$ later conveys his interest to $\\mathrm{B}$. $\\mathrm{B}$ owns an estate measured by A's life; it ends when A dies. Here, Nelson received a life estate in Redacre because the property would go to Dora on Nelson's death. When Nelson conveyed \"his interest\" to Magnolia, she received a life estate only for the period of Nelson's life. Under the doctrine of waste, the holder of a life estate is entitled to all the ordinary uses and profits of the land, but she cannot lawfully do any act that would injure the interests of the person who owns the remainder. If she does, the future interest holder may sue for damages and/or to enjoin such acts. Permissive waste occurs when the life tenant fails to take reasonable measures to protect the land, such as paying property taxes that are due. A life tenant is obligated to pay all ordinary taxes on the land to the extent of its reasonable value. Thus, Magnolia is obligated to pay property taxes for her period of occupancy. Dora holds a remainder interest in Redacre because she will acquire it when Nelson dies; therefore, she can protect her interest by compelling Magnolia to pay the taxes. (A) is incorrect because Magnolia only received the interest that Nelson had, which was an estate for his life. He did not have the power to convey a life estate for the period of Magnolia's life. (C) is wrong because, as discussed above, a life tenant has a duty to pay such taxes. (D) is incorrect because there was nothing in Orville's conveyance of the life estate to Nelson that prevented him from conveying his interest to another. Despite the general rule against restraints on alienation of property interests, a restraint on the transfer of a life estate that causes it to be forfeited if a transfer is attempted is a valid restraint on alienation. However, any such restraint must be specified in the conveyance itself. Here, no restraint on alienation existed in the conveyance to Nelson; thus, he was free to convey his interest to Magnolia.\n\n",

In the case of a will, the perpetuities period begins to run on the date of the testator's death, and measuring lives used to show the validity of an interest must be in existence at that time. An interest that violates the Rule is void and is stricken. However, all other interests created in the instrument of transfer that are valid under the Rule are given effect. Here, at the time the interests are created (Hiram's death), Horace's life estate vests immediately. The next life estate (to the eldest grandchild living at Horace's death) will vest, if at all, upon the death of Horace, a life in being at the creation of the interest. Thus, the life estate to such eldest grandchild (which turned out to be Suzanne) is valid under the Rule. However, the gift to Hiram's great-grandchildren may not vest within a life in being plus 21 years. A grandchild born after Hiram's death (who is therefore not a life in being) may survive Horace as the eldest grandchild of Hiram, and may live for 21 years after Horace's death. In that event, the gift over to the great-grandchildren would vest outside of lives in being plus 21 years. It does not matter that the grandchild who actually survived Horace as the eldest, Suzanne, was alive at Hiram's death (and therefore a life in being). The interest is void because there is a possibility, viewed at the time the interest is created, that it \n\n",

        "Explanation": " The attempted contingent gift to the Boy Scouts' Council is void under the Rule Against Perpetuities. Under the common law Rule Against Perpetuities, an interest must vest, if at all, within 21 years of a life in being. The devise to Ronald gives him a fee simple determinable subject to an executory interest and attempts to give the Boy Scouts an executory interest in fee simple. However, the Boy Scouts' interest is void under the Rule because the camp might be used for noncamping or nonrecreational purposes long after any life in being plus 21 years. Thus, what remains is Ronald's fee simple determinable interest. Since Powell did not otherwise provide who would take if the Boy Scouts' interest failed, he was left with a possibility of reverter. Such an interest is not subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities. As Powell's sole heir, Erma took his possibility of reverter, and upon her death, her heir, Harold, took the interest. Thus, Harold has a possibility of reverter and the Boy Scouts have nothing, making (D) correct and (A) incorrect. (B) is incorrect because an executory interest is a future estate of transferees. Harold's interest arises through descent from Powell, the transferor, and so it must be a possibility of reverter rather than an executory interest. (C) is incorrect; remainders, whether vested or contingent, do not follow fees simple, including fees simple determinable, because remainders follow the natural termination of the preceding estate (a life estate) and fees simple do not naturally terminate. Any interest following a fee simple determinable is either a possibility of reverter (if held by or through the transferor) or an executory interest (if held by or through the transferee).\n\n",

        "Explanation": " The nonassignment clause is valid and Miller may enforce it by terminating the lease and regaining possession of the store. Nonassignment clauses in leases are valid and enforceable even though strictly construed, and allow the landlord in most states to refuse to consent to an assignment even if the refusal is unreasonable. If a tenant makes an assignment in violation of a nonassignment clause in the lease, the transfer is not void. However, the landlord may terminate the lease if specifically provided by the nonassignment clause. Alternatively, he may sue for damages if he can prove any. Only choice (A) upholds the validity of the nonassignment clause. Choice (B) is incorrect. While most courts require a landlord to mitigate damages where a tenant unjustifiably abandons the property, this duty does not affect the landlord's power to terminate the lease because of a breach of the lease agreement. Dwight will still be liable to Miller for any damages from the unauthorized assignment, including the cost of evicting Ariel. (C) is incorrect because most states do not require that a landlord's refusal to accept a new tenant be reasonable. Furthermore, the fact that Ariel is operating the same type of business does not mean that Miller has suffered no harm, since she might be a much poorer credit risk than Dwight. (D) is incorrect. As an exception to the general rule that any restriction on the transferability of a legal interest in property is void, a provision in a lease prohibiting the lessee's assignment or subletting of her leasehold interest without the consent of the landlord is given effect in all jurisdictions.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Dan must pay 10 days' lodging because his notice to terminate will not become effective until then. In the usual case, a hotel guest is treated as a licensee rather than a tenant. Here, however, the court found that the parties created a tenancy because they specifically agreed to a week-toweek arrangement at a special weekly rate. A periodic tenancy arises when the parties do not fix the duration of the tenancy. It continues from period to period and is automatically renewed for another period until terminated by the giving of proper notice. The period is generally based on an express understanding between the parties or an implied understanding based on the payment of rent. Dan's arrangement with the hotel constitutes a periodic week-to-week tenancy because it was of indefinite duration and \"rent\" was paid each week. To terminate a periodic tenancy of less than one year, a full period in advance of the period in question is required by way of notice. For a week-to-week tenancy, notice at least one full week prior to vacating would have to be given prior to the beginning of the period. Thus, Dan's notice had no effect on his liability for that week's rent and would operate as one week's notice starting at the beginning of the next week. (A) is incorrect. If the parties had expressly agreed that either party could terminate at any time, a tenancy at will would have been created and Dan would be liable for nothing. However, the payment of rent on a regular periodic basis will cause a court to treat the tenancy as a periodic tenancy. (B) is incorrect because it does not take the one week's notice requirement into account. (C) is incorrect because the notice must fix the last day of the period as the date of termination rather than some intervening day. Thus, the notice period does not begin to run until the end of the current week.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Wallace has a valid easement, which was created by express grant, properly recorded, and presumed to be of perpetual duration. It is enforceable against Cyd, the subsequent purchaser of the servient estate, because nothing has occurred to terminate the easement. While an easement may be extinguished by abandonment, mere nonuse does not qualify as abandonment. Rather, there must be a physical manifestation of an intent to permanently abandon (e.g., building a permanent structure blocking access to the easement). Since Wallace did not manifest an intent to permanently abandon, (A) is incorrect. (C) is incorrect because Wallace has an easement created by express grant, not implied by necessity. An easement by necessity arises by implication when the owner of a tract of land sells part of the tract and by this division deprives one lot of access to a public road or utility line. Aside from the fact that Wallace has an express easement and need not resort to one by implication, nothing in these facts indicates that Wallace purchased Woodlot from the owner of Smoothacre or that the paved way through Smoothacre was Woodlot's only access to any public road. (D) is incorrect because the easement was not interfered with for the 15 -year prescription period. For an easement to terminate by prescription, the owner of the servient tenement must so interfere with the easement as to create a cause of action in favor of the easement holder. The adverse use must be open, notorious, continuous, and nonpermissive for the requisite period. The original owner of the servient estate, Arnold, apparently did nothing to interfere with Wallace's easement. Cyd, Arnold's successor, did everything necessary to terminate the easement by prescription, but his adverse use has lasted only six months instead of 15 years. \n\n",

        "Explanation": " Michael's leasing Blackacre to Theresa for 15 years will allow him to acquire title by adverse possession. Title by adverse possession results when the owner of real property does not, within the period set by the statute of limitations, take legal action to eject a possessor who claims adversely to the owner. The owner is thereafter barred from bringing suit for ejectment and title to the property vests in the possessor. For one to obtain title by adverse possession, the possession must be (i) open and notorious (i.e., such as the usual owner would make of the land), (ii) actual and exclusive (i.e., not in conjunction with the true owner or the public at large), (iii) continuous throughout the statutory period, and (iv) hostile. Here, Michael's act of leasing Blackacre is a kind of use that a true owner would make of the property; thus, it is an \"actual\" possession even though Michael himself is not living on the property. Theresa's occupancy is open and notorious, since Seymour discovered it as soon as he came to look at Blackacre. Michael's possession is exclusive because he has allowed only his tenant to enter onto the property. It is continuous because his tenant has occupied the property throughout the 15 years, and it is hostile because Michael acted without the true owner's permission and in derogation of the true owner's rights. Having satisfied all of the requirements for adverse possession, Michael should be declared to be the owner of Blackacre. (A) is incorrect because a lease to a third party does constitute actual possession by Michael. Leasing the property is a type of use that a true owner would make of the property, and occupancy by the adverse possessor's tenant would give the true owner notice that a trespass is occurring. (B) is incorrect because Seymour's ignorance of the fact that Blackacre was occupied is not an excuse. Theresa's occupancy was sufficiently apparent to put Seymour on notice that a trespass was occurring. His failure to visit the property during the statutory period provides him with no defense. (C) is incorrect because Seymour's abandonment of Blackacre is not sufficient to bestow title by adverse possession on Michael. Michael must satisfy the adverse possession requirements to obtain title.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Bart cannot evict Newt because he is not yet the owner of Springfield. The instrument of conveyance signed by Homer conveyed only a future interest and not a present estate. A future interest is an estate that does not entitle the owner thereof to possession, but it will or may in the future become a present interest. Because Homer's estate is not a life estate, the future interest conveyed to Bart is an executory interest. Furthermore, it is a springing executory interest because it divests the estate of the transferor, Homer (i.e., Homer's fee simple will be cut short if and when Bart receives his degree before age 30). Because Homer has retained his present estate, which is a fee simple subject to the springing executory interests of Bart and Lisa, only Homer would have the power to evict Newt. Bart, as the holder of a future interest, has no right to possession of the property and therefore has no cause of action against another in possession. (A) is incorrect because the language of Homer's conveyance clearly indicates that he is conveying a future interest rather than a present interest. (A) would have been correct if Homer had used the following language in his conveyance: \"to my son Bart; provided, however, that if Bart does not receive a college degree by his 30th birthday, title shall pass to my daughter Lisa.\" Bart would have had a fee simple subject to divestment by Lisa's executory interest. Here, however, Homer expressly stated that Bart's receipt of a college degree was a condition precedent to the transfer of the property. Hence, Bart has only a future interest and not a fee simple of any kind. (C) is incorrect. If Bart had acquired a present possessory interest in the property, nothing would have prevented him from evicting Newt, regardless of his motivation. (D) is incorrect. If Homer had conveyed his present interest in the property, Newt's tenancy would have been terminated by operation of law because it was, at most, a tenancy at will. However, Homer conveyed only a future interest to Bart, so the conveyance had no effect on Newt's tenancy. \n\n",

        "Explanation": " The court should require specific performance of Partridge and Wren. When a transfer of land is preceded by a contract for sale, the risk of loss to the property during that time interval is imposed on the buyer in most jurisdictions. Thus, despite a loss due to fire or other casualty (assuming it was not due to the fault of either party), the buyer must still pay the contract price at the closing date unless the contract provides otherwise. Consequently, Partridge and Wren were still under a duty to tender the amount due on the property. Their failure to do so puts them in breach of contract, allowing Eagle to obtain specific performance (payment of the balance due on the contract). (B) is wrong because the preferred remedy for Eagle is specific performance. While Eagle could obtain a damage remedy based on the difference between the contract price and the market value of the land on the date of the breach, that would leave him with the task as executor of trying to resell the property. Because land is considered unique, a buyer is entitled to specific performance of the contract. On mutuality of remedy grounds, the seller (Eagle) can also get that remedy. (C) is incorrect because, as discussed above, the destruction of the garage does not allow Partridge and Wren to avoid performing the contract. They bore the risk of loss and could not obtain a refund of the earnest money even if Eagle had not sought to enforce the contract. (D) is incorrect because the contract can be specifically enforced. The reason that the buyer bears the risk of loss is that the doctrine of equitable conversion treats the buyer as the equitable owner of the land once the contract is signed. Hence, Owl's death would not prevent Partridge and Wren from specifically enforcing the contract by requiring Eagle to transfer legal title. Mutuality of remedy requires that this same remedy be available to Owl's executor, who is regarded as being owed a debt of the balance due on the contract. Eagle can therefore require payment of the balance as specific performance of the contract.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " The court is likely to rule against Oiler because the covenant providing for the right of first refusal violates the Rule Against Perpetuities. Under the Rule, no interest in property is valid unless it must vest, if at all, no later than 21 years after a life in being at the creation of the interest. The Rule applies to rights of first refusal. Thus, if the right might be exercised later than the end of the perpetuities period, it is void. Since the interest ran to both parties' heirs and assigns, there was no limit on Oiler's right of first refusal; therefore, it could easily have been exercised beyond the perpetuities period, and so it violates the Rule. (A) is incorrect. The recording statute quoted by the question is a race-notice statute. Under a race-notice statute, a subsequent bona fide purchaser, such as Cowboy, is protected if he records before the prior grantee. To qualify as a bona fide purchaser, a person must, at the time of the conveyance, take without actual, constructive, or record notice of the prior interest. Since the deed to Astro was recorded, Cowboy had record notice of the right of first refusal because it was in his chain of title. Had the covenant been within the perpetuities period, Cowboy would not have been protected by the recording act. However, since the covenant is void, Oiler has no right to the property. Similarly, (B) is incorrect. The bad faith transaction of Astro and Ranger would not have overcome the covenant had the covenant not violated the Rule. In light of the fact that the covenant is void, however, their bad faith is irrelevant. (D) is incorrect because the covenant runs with the land. The requirements for the burden of the covenant to run are met in this case: The fact that the original covenanting parties intended the right of first refusal covenant to run to their successors is indicated by the use of the language \"heirs and assigns.\" The notice requirement was fulfilled by recording the deed. The horizontal privity requirement is satisfied by the fact that Oiler and Astro shared an interest in the land independent of the covenant, i.e., as grantor and grantee.

        "Explanation": " The court should partition Forestacre into two separate tracts. A court will presume that the devise to Pelt and Dash gave them a tenancy in common in Forestacre. Hence, each of them has the right to possess all portions of the property; neither of them has the right to exclusive possession of any part. However, any tenant in common has a right to judicial partition of the property, either in kind or by sale and division of the proceeds. When co-tenants are squabbling and cannot come to any agreement, the remedy of partition terminates the co-tenancy and divides the common property. Since Pelt and Dash cannot agree on the use of Forestacre by members of the hunting club, the court will probably partition the property. (A) is wrong because, even though there is no indication that Dash has ousted Pelt, i.e., wrongfully excluded him from possession of the property, Pelt is entitled to the remedy of partition because the parties cannot agree on the use of the property. (C) is wrong because Torrens did not own Forestacre at the time he attempted to convey the property in trust. While the instrument Torrens executed was in writing and properly identified the trustees and an appropriate beneficiary, Torrens had already conveyed away in fee simple his interest in the property; thus, he did not have the power to create a trust of Forestacre. (D) is wrong despite the fact that Pelt is entitled to possession and use of all of Forestacre to the same extent as Dash. Since the co-tenants cannot agree on this particular use of the land by members of the hunting club, a court will grant whichever tenant is before it the remedy of partition.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Dave will prevail only against Carla because only Carla has committed an actionable breach of the covenant against encumbrances. A grantor making a conveyance by general warranty deed generally makes five covenants for title, and warrants against title defects created both by herself and by all prior titleholders. The covenant of seisin, the covenant of right to convey, and the covenant against encumbrances are present covenants and are breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance. The covenant for quiet enjoyment and the covenant of warranty are future covenants and are breached only upon interference with the possession of the grantee or his successors. Unlike the future covenants, the present covenants do not \"run\" with the grantee's estate and cannot be enforced against the covenantor by successive grantees in most jurisdictions. Here, because the party holding the judgment lien has not taken any action to enforce it, there is no disturbance of possession and the future covenants have not been breached. Since the only covenant that has been breached was the covenant against encumbrances, only Dave's grantor, Carla, is liable. (A) is incorrect because most jurisdictions hold that a covenant against encumbrances is breached even if the grantee knew of the encumbrance, particularly if it is an encumbrance on title, such as a mortgage or lien, rather than a physical encumbrance such as an easement. (C) is incorrect even though it is true that Brenda will not be liable because she conveyed by special warranty deed, which covenants only that the grantor herself did not create any title defects. As discussed above, Allen is not liable to Dave because any future covenants he made have not been breached.

        "Explanation": " Christie owns Blackacre free of the mortgage because Brittany's status as a bona fide purchaser without notice brings the \"shelter rule\" into play. In general, a person who takes from a bona fide purchaser will prevail against any interest that the transferor-bona fide purchaser would have prevailed against, even if the person taking the property has actual or record notice of the prior interest. Hence, Brittany's status as a bona fide purchaser without notice \"shelters\" Christie from Maritime Bank's interest, and (C) is correct. (A) is incorrect because Christie's \"sheltered\" status as a transferee of a bona fide purchaser makes the fact that the recording act does not directly protect donees irrelevant. (B) is incorrect because a pure notice recording statute requires actual or constructive notice at the time of the conveyance. When Brittany conveyed to Christie, Maritime Bank had not yet recorded.

The common law rule that priority is given to the grantee who was first in time still applies unless operation of the jurisdiction's recording statute changes the result. The statute in this question is a race-notice statute, under which a subsequent bona fide purchaser is protected only if she records her interest before the prior grantee does. While Darlene is a bona fide purchaser, she must still win the race to the recording office to prevail over Yukon's prior interest. Since neither party has recorded in this fact pattern, Darlene will take the property subject to Yukon's prior interest. (B) is wrong because Yukon's option is treated as an interest in land just like his leasehold interest, regardless of the fact that it cannot yet be exercised. (C) is wrong because Darlene probably would prevail if she were to record now. Under the recording statute, it is irrelevant that Darlene became aware of Yukon's interest at a later point; at the time of the conveyance to her, she did not have notice of his interest and therefore qualifies as a bona fide purchaser. Had she recorded when she first encountered Yukon, she would have prevailed. Even if she were to record now, she could still prevail if Yukon does not record first. (D) is incorrect because it states the result under a notice statute. In contrast to a notice statute, the race-notice statute in the question would still permit Yukon to prevail even though he failed to record before Darlene purchased the property, as long as Darlene does not record before he does.\n\n",

When a mortgagor sells his mortgaged property and gives a deed, the grantee takes subject to the mortgage, which remains on the land.

The mortgage remained on Sweetacre and will allow First Bank to foreclose on Sweetacre unless Tully extinguishes the mortgage by paying off the entire loan.

        "Explanation": " TNB can require either Able or Brett to pay the deficiency. When a mortgage is foreclosed and the proceeds of the foreclosure sale are insufficient to satisfy the mortgage debt, the mortgagee can bring a personal action against the mortgagor for the deficiency. The mortgagor remains personally liable on the mortgage loan regardless of any subsequent transfers of the mortgaged property. Hence, Able remains liable to TNB for the deficiency because he was the original mortgagor. Brett is also liable for the deficiency because he \"assumed payment of\" the mortgage. When a grantee signs an assumption agreement, promising to pay the mortgage loan, he becomes primarily liable to the lender (who is a third-party beneficiary of the assumption agreement), while the original mortgagor becomes secondarily liable as a surety. Thus, TNB can seek judgment against either Able or Brett for the deficiency, making (B) correct and (A) incorrect. (C) and (D) are incorrect because Carly is not liable for the deficiency.

        "Explanation": " Casbank should have its mortgage fully satisfied from the proceeds of the foreclosure sale, and the remainder should go toward satisfying Brubank's junior interest. As a general rule, the priority of a mortgage is determined by the time it was placed on the property. When a mortgage is foreclosed, the buyer at the sale will take title as it existed when the mortgage was placed on the property. Thus, foreclosure will destroy interests junior to the placing of the mortgage but will not discharge senior interests, which remain on the property. However, where a landowner enters into a modification agreement with the senior mortgagee that makes the mortgage more burdensome, the junior mortgage will be given priority over the modification. In particular, if a junior mortgage is placed on the property and the senior lender later makes an optional advance while having notice of the junior lien, the advance will lose priority to the junior lien. (An optional advance is one that the senior lender is not contractually bound to make.) Here, the senior mortgage of Brubank was modified by the additional advance after creation of the junior mortgage with Casbank; hence, the increase in the debt to Brubank will not have priority over Casbank's interest. Therefore, the proceeds of the foreclosure sale will be applied first to satisfy the $\\$ 15,000$ mortgage of Casbank that is being foreclosed, and the balance of $\\$ 3,000$ will go toward the $\\$ 15,000$ modification of Brubank's mortgage. This leaves a $\\$ 12,000$ deficiency, for which Augustus might be liable, and leaves the original $\\$ 20,000$ mortgage of Brubank, which remains on the property in the hands of the foreclosure sale buyer. (A) is wrong because Brubank's senior interest on the property is not affected by Casbank's foreclosure action; since Augustus is not in default on that mortgage, Brubank is not entitled to recover foreclosure proceeds for it. (B) is incorrect because the foreclosure proceeds are not divided proportionally between the interests affected by the foreclosure; they are first applied to fully satisfy the foreclosed mortgage, and whatever is left over is applied toward any junior interests in order of priority. (D) is wrong because Brubank's additional advance is junior to the Casbank mortgage and is wiped out by its foreclosure; hence, the balance of the proceeds after Casbank's mortgage is satisfied will be paid to partially satisfy Brubank's junior interest. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "Explanation": " If Dietz did not know he was striking a person, he did not have the required intent for battery. To establish a prima facie case for an intentional tort such as battery, plaintiff must prove (i) an act by defendant, (ii) intent, and (iii) causation. The intent of the actor that is relevant for purposes of intentional torts is the intent to bring about the consequences that are the basis of the tort. An actor \"intends\" these consequences when his goal is to bring them about or when he knows with substantial certainty that they will result from his actions. The intent required for battery is an intent to bring about harmful or offensive contact to the plaintiff's person. [Restatement (Second) of Torts $\\S 13(a)$ ] If Dietz did not know that he was striking a person, he could not have intended or known that a harmful or offensive contact with the person would result. Therefore, he will not have the intent required for battery. (A) is incorrect because the intent required is not an intent to cause harm to the person, but rather an intent to bring about the harmful or offensive contact. (\"Offensive\" contact is contact that the plaintiff has not expressly or impliedly consented to.) Thus, as long as Dietz at least knew that he was bringing about an offensive contact with Pansy, he will be liable for battery even though he had no desire to harm Pansy. (B) is incorrect because Dietz's mental illness does not preclude him from possessing the requisite intent for battery. As long as he was capable of intending the consequences of his conduct, i.e., intending to bring about the harmful or offensive contact, his inability to understand that his act was wrongful is irrelevant. (D) is incorrect because the defense of self-defense is only available when a person has reasonable grounds to believe that he is being attacked or is about to be attacked. This is an objective test-how the situation would have looked to a reasonable person under the circumstances. The facts here make it clear that a reasonable person would not have believed that he was about to be attacked. Dietz therefore will not be able to successfully claim self-defense.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Paul will prevail because Donnalou had the intent to commit a battery. To establish a prima facie case for battery, plaintiff must establish (i) an act by defendant that brings about harmful or offensive contact to the plaintiff's person, (ii) intent on the part of the defendant to bring about harmful or offensive contact to plaintiff's person, and (iii) causation. The harmful or offensive contact may be either direct or indirect; i.e., it is sufficient if defendant sets in motion a force that brings about harmful or offensive contact to the plaintiff's person. Here, all of the elements are present for a battery case against Donnalou. She acted by placing the drug in Paul's juice knowing that he would drink it. While she did not expect Paul to have a severe reaction to the drug, she did intend for it to affect him; i.e., she intended an offensive contact. Paul can establish causation not only for the initial reaction but also for the injuries from the car crash, because his ingestion of the drug was a substantial factor in bringing about those injuries. Thus, Paul can establish a prima facie case for battery against Donnalou, and Donnalou has no legitimate defenses that will prevent Paul from recovering for his injuries. (A) is incorrect because Dr. Pillpush's negligence does not break the causal connection between Paul's injuries from the auto accident and Donnalou's tortious act. Even though the accident would not have occurred but for the doctor's negligence, Donnalou's conduct was the primary factor in bringing about Paul's injuries. (B) is incorrect because Donnalou's lack of intent to harm Paul is irrelevant. As long as she intended that Paul ingest the drug, she intended an offensive contact. Thus, she is liable for battery even though she did not intend to harm Paul. (C) is incorrect. Unlike in negligence cases, the unforeseeability of additional forces that contribute to plaintiff's injury in an intentional tort case does not make them superseding forces that break the causal connection between the initial wrongful act and the ultimate injury. Even if the automobile accident could not have reasonably 130. TORTS\n\nbeen foreseen, Donnalou will be liable because her conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.\n\n",

A conversion is an interference with plaintiff's possessory rights in a chattel that is so serious as to warrant that the defendant pay full value for the chattel. Here, Randy's permission to use the boat had long since expired when the boat was severely damaged by the tree. While Randy would not have been responsible for that damage had it occurred while he was still rightfully in possession of the boat, the combination of the wrongful detention and the severe damage amounts to a conversion. Hence, Steve is entitled to recover damages for the fair market value of the boat at the time and place of conversion, in effect creating a forced sale of the boat.

        "Explanation": " Mommy will lose because she will not be able to establish a prima facie case for negligent infliction of emotional distress. An action for negligent infliction of emotional distress requires plaintiff to show that defendant's conduct created a foreseeable risk of physical injury to plaintiff, and that the emotional distress caused by this conduct also resulted in some physical injury to plaintiff. Here, the first element is established because the negligence of the theater employee created a foreseeable risk that Mommy would be injured by biting down on the coin, but the second element is not established because Mommy's nightmares and loss of sleep that night do not amount to an actionable physical injury, and she suffered no other injury by biting the coin. Note that if she had suffered physical injury by biting the coin, she would have a prima facie case against the theater for negligence. She then would have been able to recover for her emotional distress as a \"parasitic\" element of her physical injury damages. (A) is incorrect because Dizzie's negligence only establishes the first element of the case for negligent infliction of emotional distress; the element of physical injury is not established. (B) is incorrect because emotional distress alone is not a sufficient injury where the defendant's conduct was only negligent. If Dizzie instead had purposely put the coin in the popcorn with knowledge or reckless disregard of the likely effect of his conduct, Mommy's emotional distress probably would be sufficient for establishing a prima facie case of intentional infliction of emotional distress. (C) is wrong because the element of emotional distress in this tort does not depend upon foreseeability or a reasonable person standard; only the initial threat of physical injury need be foreseeable.

(B) is incorrect because the fact that the guardrail meets typical industry standards does not preclude a finding of negligence. If adherence to industry standards does not prevent an unreasonable risk of harm, defendant may be in breach of its duty of ordinary care. (C) is incorrect; the fact that the dog escaped from Hound's yard would only be relevant if it indicated contributory negligence on Hound's part. In this case, Hound frequently walked the dog on his lawn without a leash and had no advance warning that the dog would suddenly bolt after a squirrel; his conduct is not so lacking in due care as to amount to contributory negligence. (D) is wrong because that option does not take into account the duty of care to avoid injury to property. Although a lesser degree of care may be required where the defendant's conduct poses a risk of harm only to property and not to persons, the same general rules of negligence apply. Hence, if Publectric's conduct creates a risk of injury to property that is deemed unreasonable (based on the magnitude of the risk and the utility of the conduct), it may incur liability even though it created no risk of injury to persons.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\n\n\nThe above chart indicates the configuration of three parcels of property located in State Blue, which has a 15-year prescription and adverse possession period. Seventeen years ago, Wallace purchased Woodlot, which is adjacent to Smoothacre and Roughacre. At the time Wallace purchased Woodlot, he asked Arnold, the owner of Smoothacre, if Arnold would grant Wallace an easement to use the paved way across Smoothacre to haul logs to the public road. Arnold was an affable person and he readily granted the easement to Wallace. Wallace paid nothing for the easement, and the deed granting the easement was properly recorded in the office of the county recorder of deeds. For six months Wallace hauled $\\operatorname{logs}$ across Smoothacre. However, Wallace decided it would be easier to haul the logs over Roughacre, because the distance to the public road was less using that route. Wallace negotiated with Brenda, the owner of Roughacre, and Brenda granted Wallace a license to haul logs on the gravel road across Roughacre to the public road. Wallace paid Brenda a modest annual fee for this privilege. In the intervening time period, Wallace never used the paved way across Smoothacre for any purpose. Six months ago, Arnold conveyed Smoothacre to Cyd, and two weeks ago, Cyd had a chain-link fence built around the perimeter of Smoothacre which, of course, blocked Wallace's access to the paved way crossing Smoothacre. One week ago, acting within her rights, Brenda revoked Wallace's license to use the gravel road crossing Roughacre. The next day, Wallace told Cyd, \"Open up that chainlink fence where Smoothacre abuts Woodlot, because I have an easement to haul my logs across your paved way.\" Cyd replied, \"Forget it, Buster.

        "Explanation": " MMMA has breached its duty of care to Norton if it had reason to know of the danger. An owner or occupier of land owes a duty of care to make the premises reasonably safe for its invitees. For an owner of a place of public accommodation who gathers the public for profit, the duty extends to protecting its patrons from injury from third persons where the owner knew or should have known of the danger. Both Martha and Norton are business invitees of Modern Mall because Martha is a potential customer of the business, even though she was not planning to buy anything, and Norton is accompanying Martha. Thus, if MMMA had reason to know of any danger to Norton from criminal acts of third persons, MMMA has breached its duty to Norton. Norton should have little difficulty establishing actual cause, proximate cause, and damages, the other elements of his prima facie case. (Assuming that MMMA had reason to know of the danger of a criminal act against Norton, the act is foreseeable and thus not a superseding intervening force that would cut off the causal connection.) Hence, MMMA is likely to be found liable to Norton. (A) is incorrect because owners of land, even those opening their premises to the public for profit, are not strictly liable to their customers for injuries from third persons. MMMA must have been negligent for it to be liable to Norton. (C) is incorrect because a criminal act of a third person is a superseding force only if it is not foreseeable. If MMMA had reason to know of the danger of a criminal act against Norton, it was negligent in failing to take steps to eliminate the danger, and this negligence created a foreseeable risk that Norton would be harmed by a third person. (D) is incorrect because Norton was accompanying Martha, who was a potential customer of the business, and is therefore an invitee as to all areas of the mall that were open to the public, including its restrooms.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " If Zarkov had reason to know of Ming's violent propensity, he could be liable for his own negligence in not attempting to search for Ming or alert the authorities. Under principles of vicarious liability, the tortious conduct of one person may be imputed to another person when a special relationship exists between the tortfeasor and the other person. However, a parent is not vicariously liable at common law for the tortious conduct of her child. The statute given in the question does not change this result; it merely establishes that Zarkov would be liable for Ming's conduct to the same extent as if he were Ming's parent. Given the absence of vicarious liability in this situation, the only liability that Zarkov might face is for his own negligence in not preventing the beating. If Zarkov had reason to know that Ming had a propensity to commit violent acts, Zarkov owed a duty to persons who might be injured by Ming, and this duty was breached by Zarkov's inaction after Ming was reported missing. Whether Zarkov's negligence can be shown to be the actual cause of Gordon's injury is not conclusively established by the facts; given the short interval between when Ming ran away and when he was discovered missing, and the long interval between the discovery and the beating a few blocks away from the institute, Gordon probably can prove actual cause. Proximate cause can also be established because Ming's intentional tort was foreseeable; it was the very conduct that Zarkov had a duty to take precautions against. Hence, given the factual assumption in choice (D), Zarkov probably will be liable for Gordon's injuries. (A) is incorrect because whether or not Ming would be liable for administering the beating has no effect on Zarkov's liability for his own negligence. (B) is wrong because the statute merely makes those standing in loco parentis liable to the same extent as parents. Because parents would not be liable in the absence of reason to know of their child's violent propensity, Zarkov also would be liable only under those circumstances. (C) is incorrect even though its statement of law is accurate. While Zarkov cannot be found vicariously liable for Ming's acts, he may be liable for his own negligence under the circumstances stated in choice (D).\n\n",

        "Explanation": " The court should grant Shortstop's motion for a directed verdict because Jason has not established a prima facie case of negligence on Shortstop's part. Jason has established that Shortstop owed a duty to him and that he has suffered harm from the fire caused by the short in the wiring. However, he has not established that Shortstop breached any duty to him. While breach of duty is ordinarily a question for the trier of fact, plaintiff's failure to offer any evidence on that element of the prima facie case will permit a directed verdict for defendant. Under certain circumstances, the fact that a particular injury occurred may itself establish or tend to establish a breach of duty owed, permitting the trier of fact to infer defendant's liability. This is the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur (\"the thing speaks for itself\"). However, for the doctrine to apply, plaintiff must show that (i) the accident causing his injury is the type that would not normally occur unless someone was negligent; (ii) the negligence was attributable to defendant; and (iii) the injury was not attributable to plaintiff. The second requirement can often be satisfied by showing that the instrumentality causing the injury was in the exclusive control of the defendant. Here, however, the wiring was exposed to work done by other contractors on an immediately adjacent chimney and hot water pipe, and in putting up the walls, and Jason has offered no evidence that the cut in the outer sheath of the wiring was present when Shortstop finished its work. Instead, the fact that the wiring had been approved by the building inspector suggests that the wiring was intact when Shortstop finished. Given these facts, Jason has not presented evidence that the negligence was attributable to the defendant. Since res ipsa loquitur does not apply and no other evidence of breach of duty was established, Shortstop's motion for a directed verdict should be granted. (C) is therefore correct and (A) and (B) are incorrect. (B) is also incorrect because Jason's motion for a directed verdict would be denied even if he had established res ipsa loquitur. Establishing res ipsa loquitur merely creates a permissible inference of negligence; it does not create a presumption of negligence. Where the res ipsa loquitur element has been proved, plaintiff has established a prima facie breach of duty on defendant's part and no directed verdict may be given for defendant. However, it does not require defendant to present evidence to rebut a presumption. The trier of fact is free to accept the inference of negligence that has been created and find for the plaintiff or reject the inference of negligence and find for the defendant, even if the defendant offers no other evidence on the issue. Thus, the court would not grant Jason's motion for a directed verdict even if he had established res ipsa loquitur. (D) is incorrect because Shortstop is not strictly liable for the short in the wiring. Jason's failure to offer some evidence of negligence on the part of Shortstop will allow Shortstop to prevail.\n\n",

Seeing no other way out, he decided to sell Cattlefork, a distant ranch that had been in his family for generations, to his childhood nemesis, Astro. Not wanting to lose control of the family property forever, Oiler inserted a provision in the deed to Astro binding \"Astro, his heirs, and assigns\" to offer \"Oiler, his heirs, and assigns\" the right of first refusal to purchase Cattlefork when it was offered for sale. Astro was not happy with the provision, but Oiler refused to sell the property without the covenant included. Astro reluctantly agreed. Cattlefork was conveyed to Astro, and the deed containing the right of first refusal was duly recorded.\n\nAstro lived on Cattlefork for 23 years. His dislike for Oiler was so great that he did not want Oiler to ever get the property back. Therefore, Astro devised a stratagem to get around the covenant. When informed that Cowboy was interested in buying the property, Astro decided to execute his plan. Astro's friend Ranger agreed to act as a \"straw man\" to avoid the consequences of the covenant. Astro deeded Cattlefork as a \"gift\" to Ranger. Ranger recorded the deed, which did not contain the right of first refusal covenant, and Ranger then sold the land to Cowboy for $\\$ 200,000$, giving the proceeds of the sale to Astro.

        "Explanation": " If a hospital employee was negligent in strapping Paul to the table, the hospital is vicariously liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior. This doctrine imposes liability on an employer for the tortious conduct of its employee occurring within the scope of the employment relationship. Here, strapping Paul to the table was one of the employee's tasks. Since this task was performed negligently and this negligence was one of the causes of Paul's injuries, the hospital would be liable. $(\\mathrm{B})$ is wrong because the failure to make a reasonable inspection of the footrest is not the negligent conduct suggested by the facts; rather, it was the failure to strap Paul in securely that probably was negligent. (C) is incorrect because the hospital will be liable even if Paul cannot identify which specific hospital employee was negligent. Through the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, Paul can establish breach of duty just by the fact that Paul fell off the table after he had been strapped in; in other words, an inference of negligence is established because the accident causing his injury is the type that would not normally occur unless someone was negligent. The other two elements required for res ipsa loquitur are that plaintiff was free of fault, which is easy to show in this case, and that the negligence was attributable to the defendant; i.e., that this type of accident ordinarily happens because of the negligence of someone in defendant's position. This requirement often can be satisfied by showing that the instrumentality that caused the injury was in the exclusive control of the defendant. If Paul were suing the nurses or technicians individually, this requirement would prevent him from using res ipsa loquitur in most jurisdictions because he could not establish which individual party was negligent. However, the hospital will be liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior regardless of which of its employees was negligent, because the hospital, through its employees, did have exclusive control over the $x$-ray table. (D) is incorrect because Doctors' Hospital could still lose even if the injury to Paul was caused by a defect present at the time the x-ray table was purchased, if the defect could have been easily discovered through a reasonable inspection.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Mac's is strictly liable to Pedro if Mac's sold a defective tire to Sandra. The question does not indicate what theory Pedro is using in his products liability action, so you should analyze the facts under a strict liability theory because it is the easiest theory for a plaintiff to establish. In a strict liability action based on a defective product, plaintiff must prove that (i) defendant was a commercial supplier owing a strict duty, (ii) the duty was breached because the product was supplied in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to users, (iii) the defect was the actual and proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries, and (iv) plaintiff suffered damages. Here, Mac's is a commercial supplier because it is a retailer of the tires, and therefore owes a strict duty to any user or foreseeable bystander; Pedro need not have purchased the tire from Mac's to recover. If the tire was defective when it was placed into commerce by the manufacturer, it would be unreasonably dangerous, i.e., dangerous beyond the expectation of the ordinary consumer, and Mac's would be in breach of its strict duty by selling it. Pedro can establish actual cause by showing that, but for the defect, the tire would not have suddenly blown out and the car would not have crashed. Proximate cause can be shown even if Sandra, the original purchaser, was negligent in not discovering the defect before selling the car to Pedro, because the negligent failure of an intermediary to discover a defect is not a superseding cause that would cut off the supplier's strict liability. Upon proof of the final element, damages, Pedro can recover from Mac's on a strict liability theory. (A) is incorrect because the fact that the tire blew out for no apparent reason is not sufficient to establish that the tire was defective when it was placed in commerce, which is a necessary element to impose strict liability on commercial suppliers. While the fact that the tire blew out suggests that it may have been defective, Pedro must present some evidence that the blowout was not caused by improper use or maintenance by either Sandra or him. (C) is incorrect because the care taken by Mac's in distributing tires from a reputable manufacturer, while it would be a defense in an action based on negligence, is not a defense in an action based on strict liability. Because strict liability may be one of the theories Pedro is using, $(\\mathrm{C})$ is not the best choice. Similarly, (D) is incorrect because even if Pedro's exceeding the speed limit was contributory negligence, it would not be a defense to a strict liability action in a jurisdiction retaining traditional contributory negligence doctrines. The fact that it was widely known in the tire industry that users would exceed posted speed limits indicates that Pedro's misuse of the tires was reasonably foreseeable; hence, it is a type of ordinary negligence that is not a defense in a strict liability action.\n\n",

Whether an activity is abnormally dangerous is a question of law that the court can decide on a motion for a directed verdict. Since Canyon City has presented no evidence of negligence on Gasmask's part, the only way that Canyon City can survive Gasmask's directed verdict motion is if the court finds that a strict liability standard applies, as suggested by (C). Choice (A) is incorrect. While no evidence of a breach of duty owed in negligence has been shown, Canyon City has presented enough evidence to establish breach of Gasmask's absolute duty to make the storage safe, if the court finds that Gasmask was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity. Canyon City has a cause of action for the breach of duty because its use of the water table adjacent to the storage site makes it a foreseeable plaintiff. (B) is incorrect because the fact that Canyon City drilled its wells after Gasmask stored its chemicals would not bar Canyon City from recovering and would have no effect on Gasmask's motion. This defense, called \"coming to the nuisance,\" is generally rejected by the courts. (D) is incorrect because, as discussed above, whether the elements making an activity abnormally dangerous are present is a question of law for the court rather than a question of fact.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Donald is jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of Pluto's damages that Pluto himself was not responsible for, but can obtain contribution from Mickey in proportion to Mickey's fault. Comparative negligence jurisdictions allow a plaintiff to recover some percentage of his damages even though he was contributorily negligent in causing the accident. \"Pure\" comparative negligence allows a plaintiff some recovery no matter how great his negligence was. Most comparative negligence jurisdictions retain the doctrine of joint and several liability, which makes each of several tortfeasors liable to the plaintiff for the entire amount of damages to which the plaintiff is entitled. However, if one tortfeasor does have to pay the plaintiff the entire judgment, the rule of contribution allows the paying tortfeasor to recover the excess over his share from the nonpaying tortfeasor. If contribution is based on comparative fault, the nonpaying tortfeasor is required to contribute an amount in proportion to his relative fault. Here, Pluto suffered $\\$ 100,000$ in damages but was $30 \\%$ at fault, allowing him a net recovery of $\\$ 70,000-\\$ 100,000$ minus $30 \\%(\\$ 30,000)$. He can recover the entire $\\$ 70,000$ from Donald because the jurisdiction retains the doctrine of joint and several liability. However, under a system of contribution based on comparative fault, Donald can compel Mickey to pay him $\\$ 40,000$ as contribution because Mickey was $40 \\%$ at fault in causing the $\\$ 100,000$ of damages incurred by Pluto. (B) is incorrect. If Donald did only pay $\\$ 40,000$ to Pluto, he could compel Mickey to pay $\\$ 10,000$ as contribution (because Donald's proportional share of the damages is only $\\$ 30,000$ ). However, because Donald is jointly and severally liable, Pluto can collect up to $\\$ 70,000$ from him. (C) is incorrect because Donald is liable for more than his proportional share of the damages if the jurisdiction provides for joint and several liability. (D) is incorrect because a pure comparative negligence jurisdiction allows recovery no matter how great plaintiff's negligence is compared with defendant's. (D) probably also would be incorrect in a \"partial\" comparative negligence jurisdiction that only allows plaintiff to recover if he is less at fault than defendant. Most of these jurisdictions use a \"combined comparison\" approach when several tortfeasors are involved, comparing plaintiff's negligence with the total negligence of all of the defendants combined. Because Pluto was only $30 \\%$ at fault and Donald and Mickey together were $70 \\%$ at fault, Pluto could recover against Donald even in a partial comparative negligence jurisdiction.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " In the absence of joint and several liability, Donald is liable only for the portion of Pluto's damages for which he was responsible. As discussed in the answer to the preceding question, joint and several liability makes each of several negligent actors liable to the plaintiff for the entire amount of damages to which plaintiff is entitled. Because the jurisdiction has abolished this rule, Donald is liable to Pluto for only $30 \\%$ of his damages $(\\$ 30,000)$, because Donald was $30 \\%$ at fault in causing the accident. (A) is incorrect because the jurisdiction has abolished joint and several liability.

Dietz had a long history of mental illness and had been in and out of institutions since he was an adolescent. Although Dietz would improve for a while, he was subject to recurrent hallucinations and delusions involving a belief that people, animals, and alien beings from another planet were about to attack him. Pansy was peacefully walking along a quiet residential street in Kirbyville. It happened to be the same street as that along which Dietz was walking. Pansy noticed that a person was walking up the street on the sidewalk towards her, but she did not know Dietz. When Dietz saw Pansy approaching him, he pulled a softdrink bottle from his shopping bag and hurled it at Pansy, striking her in the head and causing her injury. Afterwards Pansy filed a civil battery action against Dietz.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, provides the best defense for Dietz?\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Dietz had no desire to harm Pansy.\n\n(B) Because of his mental illness, Dietz did not understand that his act was wrongful.\n\n(C) Dietz did not know he was striking a person.\n\n(D) Dietz thought Pansy was about to attack him.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": " If Dietz did not know he was striking a person, he did not have the required intent for battery. To establish a prima facie case for an intentional tort such as battery, plaintiff must prove (i) an act by defendant, (ii) intent, and (iii) causation. The intent of the actor that is relevant for purposes of intentional torts is the intent to bring about the consequences that are the basis of the tort. An actor \"intends\" these consequences when his goal is to bring them about or when he knows with substantial certainty that they will result from his actions. The intent required for battery is an intent to bring about harmful or offensive contact to the plaintiff's person. [Restatement (Second) of Torts $\\S 13(a)$ ] If Dietz did not know that he was striking a person, he could not have intended or known that a harmful or offensive contact with the person would result. Therefore, he will not have the intent required for battery. (A) is incorrect because the intent required is not an intent to cause harm to the person, but rather an intent to bring about the harmful or offensive contact. (\"Offensive\" contact is contact that the plaintiff has not expressly or impliedly consented to.) Thus, as long as Dietz at least knew that he was bringing about an offensive contact with Pansy, he will be liable for battery even though he had no desire to harm Pansy. (B) is incorrect because Dietz's mental illness does not preclude him from possessing the requisite intent for battery. As long as he was capable of intending the consequences of his conduct, i.e., intending to bring about the harmful or offensive contact, his inability to understand that his act was wrongful is irrelevant. (D) is incorrect because the defense of self-defense is only available when a person has reasonable grounds to believe that he is being attacked or is about to be attacked. This is an objective test-how the situation would have looked to a reasonable person under the circumstances. The facts here make it clear that a reasonable person would not have believed that he was about to be attacked. Dietz therefore will not be able to successfully claim self-defense.\n\n",

Knowing where Paul, a creature of habit, always kept his lunch box, she put a small quantity of mescaline, a synthetic hallucinogen, in Paul's thermos bottle of cranberry juice. She expected that strait-laced Paul would have a minor vision or two and act in a goofy and comical manner. However, when Paul drank his mescaline-laced juice at lunchtime he had a severe reaction to the mescaline and experienced wild hallucinations. Donnalou promptly drove Paul to the emergency room of nearby Hacksaw Hospital. Paul was put under observation for a couple of hours. The emergency room physician, Pillpush, was very busy and negligently released Paul prematurely. The next day, while driving, Paul had another powerful hallucination and drove his car into a bridge abutment. Paul suffered contusions, abrasions, a concussion, and several broken bones. After Paul recovered he sued Donnalou for his injuries.\n\nWho will prevail?\n\n",

        "Final Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": " Paul will prevail because Donnalou had the intent to commit a battery. To establish a prima facie case for battery, plaintiff must establish (i) an act by defendant that brings about harmful or offensive contact to the plaintiff's person, (ii) intent on the part of the defendant to bring about harmful or offensive contact to plaintiff's person, and (iii) causation. The harmful or offensive contact may be either direct or indirect; i.e., it is sufficient if defendant sets in motion a force that brings about harmful or offensive contact to the plaintiff's person. Here, all of the elements are present for a battery case against Donnalou. She acted by placing the drug in Paul's juice knowing that he would drink it. While she did not expect Paul to have a severe reaction to the drug, she did intend for it to affect him; i.e., she intended an offensive contact. Paul can establish causation not only for the initial reaction but also for the injuries from the car crash, because his ingestion of the drug was a substantial factor in bringing about those injuries. Thus, Paul can establish a prima facie case for battery against Donnalou, and Donnalou has no legitimate defenses that will prevent Paul from recovering for his injuries. (A) is incorrect because Dr. Pillpush's negligence does not break the causal connection between Paul's injuries from the auto accident and Donnalou's tortious act. Even though the accident would not have occurred but for the doctor's negligence, Donnalou's conduct was the primary factor in bringing about Paul's injuries. (B) is incorrect because Donnalou's lack of intent to harm Paul is irrelevant. As long as she intended that Paul ingest the drug, she intended an offensive contact. Thus, she is liable for battery even though she did not intend to harm Paul. (C) is incorrect. Unlike in negligence cases, the unforeseeability of additional forces that contribute to plaintiff's injury in an intentional tort case does not make them superseding forces that break the causal connection between the initial wrongful act and the ultimate injury. Even if the automobile accident could not have reasonably 130. TORTS\n\nbeen foreseen, Donnalou will be liable because her conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.\n\n",

Randy took the boat out on the lake for a while and then decided to cruise through a system of inland waterways to a larger chain of lakes. The fishing was so good that Randy stayed overnight there and fished most of the next day. On his way back, the boat was struck and seriously damaged by a large tree that fell from the bank without warning. Randy managed to bring the boat back to his house. Just as he got in, Steve called, demanding to know why Randy had not brought it back when he was supposed to. Randy promised that he would bring it back as soon as he could, but Steve replied that he was coming over right now to pick it up. Randy did not want to be around when Steve saw the damage to the boat, so he went out to the store. It was dark when Steve arrived, and he accidently ran over a corner of Randy's garden when he backed his truck up to the boat trailer. When he saw the damage to the boat, however, he left it there and went home.\n\nAssuming that the boat was worth $\\$ 18,000$ before it was damaged and sustained $\\$ 9,000$ worth of damage, what is the most that Steve will be entitled to recover in an action against Randy?\n",

        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": " Steve can recover $\\$ 18,000$ from Randy for conversion. A conversion is an interference with plaintiff's possessory rights in a chattel that is so serious as to warrant that the defendant pay full value for the chattel. Here, Randy's permission to use the boat had long since expired when the boat was severely damaged by the tree. While Randy would not have been responsible for that damage had it occurred while he was still rightfully in possession of the boat, the combination of the wrongful detention and the severe damage amounts to a conversion. Hence, Steve is entitled to recover damages for the fair market value of the boat at the time and place of conversion, in effect creating a forced sale of the boat. (A) and (B) are wrong because Steve can recover more than the actual damage to the boat and damages for dispossession; those remedies are appropriate for trespass to chattels, which is a less serious interference with plaintiff's possessory rights in a chattel. (B) and (D) are wrong because Steve is not liable for the damage to Randy's garden when he went to retrieve the boat. When a chattel is located on the land of a wrongdoer, the owner is privileged to enter upon the land and reclaim it in a reasonable manner. Unlike an entry onto the land of an innocent party, reasonable entry onto the land of a wrongdoer is completely privileged; i.e., the chattel owner does not have to pay for any actual damage caused by the entry.\n\n",

Mommy's husband, Hal, talked Mommy into going to a movie to have a relaxing evening out. She agreed after her mother agreed to watch Boy for the evening. Mommy was enjoying the movie when Hal left his seat to get some popcorn from the concession stand. Hal ordered a large popcorn with extra butter. While handling change, Dizzie, the concession stand attendant, carelessly dropped a quarter into Hal's popcorn. After taking a couple of handfuls for himself, Hal returned to his seat and gave the popcorn box to Mommy. Mommy began to eat the popcorn. However, as she began to munch her third handful of popcorn, she bit the quarter that Dizzie had dropped into the box. Mommy did not swallow the quarter, nor did she bite on it hard enough to injure her teeth or gums, but the feel of the coin brought back all her anxieties about Boy's injury.

        "Final Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": " Mommy will lose because she will not be able to establish a prima facie case for negligent infliction of emotional distress. An action for negligent infliction of emotional distress requires plaintiff to show that defendant's conduct created a foreseeable risk of physical injury to plaintiff, and that the emotional distress caused by this conduct also resulted in some physical injury to plaintiff. Here, the first element is established because the negligence of the theater employee created a foreseeable risk that Mommy would be injured by biting down on the coin, but the second element is not established because Mommy's nightmares and loss of sleep that night do not amount to an actionable physical injury, and she suffered no other injury by biting the coin. Note that if she had suffered physical injury by biting the coin, she would have a prima facie case against the theater for negligence. She then would have been able to recover for her emotional distress as a \"parasitic\" element of her physical injury damages. (A) is incorrect because Dizzie's negligence only establishes the first element of the case for negligent infliction of emotional distress; the element of physical injury is not established. (B) is incorrect because emotional distress alone is not a sufficient injury where the defendant's conduct was only negligent. If Dizzie instead had purposely put the coin in the popcorn with knowledge or reckless disregard of the likely effect of his conduct, Mommy's emotional distress probably would be sufficient for establishing a prima facie case of intentional infliction of emotional distress. (C) is wrong because the element of emotional distress in this tort does not depend upon foreseeability or a reasonable person standard; only the initial threat of physical injury need be foreseeable. Had Mommy otherwise established a prima facie case by proving physical injury, the fact that a reasonable person would not have suffered similar distress is irrelevant.\n\n",

Access to the underground lines was through a utility hole, which Publectric had left uncovered. Publectric installed a modern guardrail around the hole to prevent members of the public from falling into the hole. Although the rail completely surrounded the utility hole, there was an opening in one part of the railing which made it easier to pass down tools to those working below.\n\nHound, a dog fancier, lived in a single-family home across the street from where the Publectric utility hole was located. Hound owned \"Hobson's Hotspur of Trent,\"' a champion springer spaniel whom Hound exhibited at dog shows. The dog was also a family pet and was known affectionately to Hound's family as \"Hobby.\" Hound's home had a large front lawn where Hound often walked Hobby without first leashing him. One such afternoon, Hobby saw a squirrel and suddenly bolted away from Hound's lawn. Hobby dashed across the street, passed through the opening of the guardrail, and fell into the utility hole, suffering broken bones and internal injuries. Although expensive and lengthy care by veterinary specialists saved Hobby's life, the dog was no longer of \"show quality\" after the injuries.\n\nAssume that the jurisdiction in which West Howard is located still recognizes all the common law defenses to tort liability.

        "Answer Choices": "(A)  No, unless Publectric failed to exercise reasonable care in making the dangerous condition safe.\n\n(B) No, if the guardrail used by Publectric meets typical industry standards.\n\n(C) No, because the dog escaped from Hound's yard. (D) No, unless a reasonably careful person would have been injured in the same manner.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": " Hound could not recover his economic losses from the injury to his dog unless Publectric was negligent. If Publectric was negligent, Hound could recover any property damage caused by the negligence, including whatever decline in the dog's value Hound is able to prove. (B) is incorrect because the fact that the guardrail meets typical industry standards does not preclude a finding of negligence. If adherence to industry standards does not prevent an unreasonable risk of harm, defendant may be in breach of its duty of ordinary care. (C) is incorrect; the fact that the dog escaped from Hound's yard would only be relevant if it indicated contributory negligence on Hound's part. In this case, Hound frequently walked the dog on his lawn without a leash and had no advance warning that the dog would suddenly bolt after a squirrel; his conduct is not so lacking in due care as to amount to contributory negligence. (D) is wrong because that option does not take into account the duty of care to avoid injury to property. Although a lesser degree of care may be required where the defendant's conduct poses a risk of harm only to property and not to persons, the same general rules of negligence apply. Hence, if Publectric's conduct creates a risk of injury to property that is deemed unreasonable (based on the magnitude of the risk and the utility of the conduct), it may incur liability even though it created no risk of injury to persons.\n\n",

Modern Mall was, as its name describes, a modern mall development containing many different stores. The mall was entirely enclosed to provide protection from the elements. Martha had spent about half an hour at the mall without purchasing anything. In fact, her main purpose for going to the mall was \"window shopping,\" a pastime that Martha found extremely enjoyable. At that time Norton told Martha that he needed to use the restroom and that he was going to the nearest men's room. Martha agreed to wait for him in front of Lacy's Lingerie Boutique. Norton entered the men's room. He was followed by Barry, a convicted child molester released on parole. Barry cornered Norton in the men's room and sexually molested him.

        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": " MMMA has breached its duty of care to Norton if it had reason to know of the danger. An owner or occupier of land owes a duty of care to make the premises reasonably safe for its invitees. For an owner of a place of public accommodation who gathers the public for profit, the duty extends to protecting its patrons from injury from third persons where the owner knew or should have known of the danger. Both Martha and Norton are business invitees of Modern Mall because Martha is a potential customer of the business, even though she was not planning to buy anything, and Norton is accompanying Martha. Thus, if MMMA had reason to know of any danger to Norton from criminal acts of third persons, MMMA has breached its duty to Norton. Norton should have little difficulty establishing actual cause, proximate cause, and damages, the other elements of his prima facie case. (Assuming that MMMA had reason to know of the danger of a criminal act against Norton, the act is foreseeable and thus not a superseding intervening force that would cut off the causal connection.) Hence, MMMA is likely to be found liable to Norton. (A) is incorrect because owners of land, even those opening their premises to the public for profit, are not strictly liable to their customers for injuries from third persons. MMMA must have been negligent for it to be liable to Norton. (C) is incorrect because a criminal act of a third person is a superseding force only if it is not foreseeable. If MMMA had reason to know of the danger of a criminal act against Norton, it was negligent in failing to take steps to eliminate the danger, and this negligence created a foreseeable risk that Norton would be harmed by a third person. (D) is incorrect because Norton was accompanying Martha, who was a potential customer of the business, and is therefore an invitee as to all areas of the mall that were open to the public, including its restrooms.\n\n",

        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Penquist was aware that another exit on the other side of the garage was open.\n\n(B) The construction workers responsible for blocking off the exit ramp were employees of an independent contractor rather than the city.\n\n(C) The city does not collect fees or make a profit in the operation of the garage.\n\n(D) Totten could have avoided Penquist but recognized him as an old enemy and deliberately ran into him.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": " The fact least helpful to the city's defense of Penquist's lawsuit is the identity of the workers who blocked the exit ramp. Under vicarious liability rules, a principal will be liable for the tortious acts of an independent contractor if the duty is nondelegable on public policy grounds; included is the duty of a possessor of land to keep its premises safe for its invitees. If the workers were negligent in leaving the ramp blocked without providing another means of exiting, the fact that they were not city employees would not absolve the city of liability; hence, their identity would be of no help to the city's defense. (A) is incorrect because if Penquist was aware of an alternate route, he may have been contributorily negligent in exiting down the entrance ramp. A plaintiff's contributory negligence may be established by violation of an applicable statute. However, as with a statutory duty imposed on defendant, plaintiff's violation of the statute may be excused if compliance was beyond plaintiff's control.

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nState Green had a law on its statute books that made any teacher, guardian, therapist, school administrator, or any other person standing in loco parentis subject to the same rights and duties as actual parents. In effect this meant that persons standing in loco parentis could be charged with liability in cases where a parent would have been liable and granted immunity from liability where such would have been the case for a parent. Dr. Zarkov had a Ph.D. in child psychology and was the director of the Verdant Institute, a residential home for disturbed minors located in Verdant City, the largest city in State Green. The Verdant Institute had no fence surrounding its premises, but regular bedchecks were conducted each night to determine that all of the disturbed children were present. A bedcheck determined that Ming, a 12-year-old resident of the Institute, was absent. In fact, Ming had climbed out a window and run away about 15 minutes before the bedcheck. The security guard who conducted the bedcheck immediately reported to Zarkov that Ming was missing. Zarkov did not report Ming's absence to the police or any other authority. Thirty-six hours after Ming ran away from the Institute, Ming savagely beat and severely injured six-year-old Gordon, a child who lived a few blocks away from the Verdant Institute. Although Gordon recovered, physicians indicated that the beating might well cause Gordon to suffer permanent hearing and vision deficiencies. Gordon's parents filed suit against Zarkov on Gordon's behalf.\n\nWhich party is likely to prevail in the lawsuit?\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Gordon, unless a 12-year-old would not be liable for administering the beating.\n\n(B) Gordon, because Zarkov assumed the role of a parent and liability is, therefore, imposed under the in loco parentis statute.\n\n(C) Zarkov, because he cannot be found vicariously liable for Ming's acts inasmuch as parents are not vicariously liable for the intentional torts of their children.\n\n(D) Zarkov, unless Zarkov had reason to know that Ming had a propensity to commit violent acts. \n\n",
        "Final Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": " If Zarkov had reason to know of Ming's violent propensity, he could be liable for his own negligence in not attempting to search for Ming or alert the authorities. Under principles of vicarious liability, the tortious conduct of one person may be imputed to another person when a special relationship exists between the tortfeasor and the other person. However, a parent is not vicariously liable at common law for the tortious conduct of her child. The statute given in the question does not change this result; it merely establishes that Zarkov would be liable for Ming's conduct to the same extent as if he were Ming's parent. Given the absence of vicarious liability in this situation, the only liability that Zarkov might face is for his own negligence in not preventing the beating. If Zarkov had reason to know that Ming had a propensity to commit violent acts, Zarkov owed a duty to persons who might be injured by Ming, and this duty was breached by Zarkov's inaction after Ming was reported missing. Whether Zarkov's negligence can be shown to be the actual cause of Gordon's injury is not conclusively established by the facts; given the short interval between when Ming ran away and when he was discovered missing, and the long interval between the discovery and the beating a few blocks away from the institute, Gordon probably can prove actual cause. Proximate cause can also be established because Ming's intentional tort was foreseeable; it was the very conduct that Zarkov had a duty to take precautions against. Hence, given the factual assumption in choice (D), Zarkov probably will be liable for Gordon's injuries. (A) is incorrect because whether or not Ming would be liable for administering the beating has no effect on Zarkov's liability for his own negligence. (B) is wrong because the statute merely makes those standing in loco parentis liable to the same extent as parents. Because parents would not be liable in the absence of reason to know of their child's violent propensity, Zarkov also would be liable only under those circumstances. (C) is incorrect even though its statement of law is accurate. While Zarkov cannot be found vicariously liable for Ming's acts, he may be liable for his own negligence under the circumstances stated in choice (D).\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nAfter several years in the planning, Jason was ready to begin building his dream house. To save money, he decided to act as the general contractor and hire all of the subcontractors himself. He hired separate contractors for the foundation, the frame, the electricity, the plumbing, and the masonry. After several months of work, the house was finally ready for occupancy. The first night that Jason stayed there, however, a fire swept through the house. Jason managed to escape with a broken ankle and some minor burns, but the house was a total loss. An investigation by the fire marshal established that the fire started from a short in some wiring behind a wall. A small section of wiring that ran to an outlet through a narrow gap between a furnace chimney and a hot water pipe had had part of its outer sheath cut off. Both the chimney and the pipe had been installed, and the walls put up, after the rough wiring had been completed.\n\nJason filed suit against Shortstop Electrical Service, the contractor that did the rough wiring. The parties stipulated that Shortstop had installed the wiring in compliance with the detailed blueprints that Jason had drawn up, and that the wiring had been inspected and approved by the building inspector shortly after it had been installed. At trial, Jason introduced the report of the fire marshal establishing the above facts and evidence of his medical expenses and other damages. At the end of Jason's case, Shortstop's attorney rested her case and moved for a directed verdict. Jason's attorney also moved for a directed verdict. How should the court rule on the directed verdict motions?\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Deny both directed verdict motions, because Jason has presented enough evidence to submit the case to the jury.\n\n(B) Deny Shortstop's motion and grant Jason's motion for a directed verdict, because Shortstop failed to rebut the presumption of negligence that Jason has established.\n\n(C) Deny Jason's motion and grant Shortstop's motion for a directed verdict, because the wire could have been damaged by another contractor.\n\n(D) Deny Shortstop's motion and grant Jason's motion for a directed verdict, because a short in the wiring caused Jason's injuries. \n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": " The court should grant Shortstop's motion for a directed verdict because Jason has not established a prima facie case of negligence on Shortstop's part. Jason has established that Shortstop owed a duty to him and that he has suffered harm from the fire caused by the short in the wiring. However, he has not established that Shortstop breached any duty to him. While breach of duty is ordinarily a question for the trier of fact, plaintiff's failure to offer any evidence on that element of the prima facie case will permit a directed verdict for defendant. Under certain circumstances, the fact that a particular injury occurred may itself establish or tend to establish a breach of duty owed, permitting the trier of fact to infer defendant's liability. This is the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur (\"the thing speaks for itself\"). However, for the doctrine to apply, plaintiff must show that (i) the accident causing his injury is the type that would not normally occur unless someone was negligent; (ii) the negligence was attributable to defendant; and (iii) the injury was not attributable to plaintiff. The second requirement can often be satisfied by showing that the instrumentality causing the injury was in the exclusive control of the defendant. Here, however, the wiring was exposed to work done by other contractors on an immediately adjacent chimney and hot water pipe, and in putting up the walls, and Jason has offered no evidence that the cut in the outer sheath of the wiring was present when Shortstop finished its work. Instead, the fact that the wiring had been approved by the building inspector suggests that the wiring was intact when Shortstop finished. Given these facts, Jason has not presented evidence that the negligence was attributable to the defendant. Since res ipsa loquitur does not apply and no other evidence of breach of duty was established, Shortstop's motion for a directed verdict should be granted. (C) is therefore correct and (A) and (B) are incorrect. (B) is also incorrect because Jason's motion for a directed verdict would be denied even if he had established res ipsa loquitur. Establishing res ipsa loquitur merely creates a permissible inference of negligence; it does not create a presumption of negligence. Where the res ipsa loquitur element has been proved, plaintiff has established a prima facie breach of duty on defendant's part and no directed verdict may be given for defendant. However, it does not require defendant to present evidence to rebut a presumption. The trier of fact is free to accept the inference of negligence that has been created and find for the plaintiff or reject the inference of negligence and find for the defendant, even if the defendant offers no other evidence on the issue. Thus, the court would not grant Jason's motion for a directed verdict even if he had established res ipsa loquitur. (D) is incorrect because Shortstop is not strictly liable for the short in the wiring. Jason's failure to offer some evidence of negligence on the part of Shortstop will allow Shortstop to prevail.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nSandra had 30,000 miles on her car when she purchased four new \"Huggums\" tires from Mac's Tire and Muffler Shop. The \"Huggums\" tires were manufactured by Kimbo Tire and Rubber Company, a reputable tire manufacturer. It was widely known in the tire industry that purchasers of tires would, on occasion, exceed posted speed limits, and therefore tires were designed to perform at speeds higher than the maximum speed of 65 m.p.h. allowable in most states. Sandra was a safe and careful driver who never exceeded the speed limit.\n\nWhen Sandra's car had 32,000 miles on it, she sold the car to Pedro. Pedro immediately took the car on a 500-mile trip to visit his sister. During the course of the journey, Pedro often drove his car 10 m.p.h. over the posted limit of 65 m.p.h. As Pedro approached his destination, he was driving 73 m.p.h. on smooth pavement. Suddenly his left front tire blew out for no apparent reason. The car went out of control, crashed into another vehicle, and Pedro was severely injured.\n\nIf Pedro sues Mac's for his injuries in a jurisdiction retaining traditional contributory negligence rules, Pedro should:\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Recover, because the tire blew out for no apparent reason.\n\n(B) Recover, if the tire was defective when it left Kimbo's manufacturing plant.\n\n(C) Not recover, if Mac's had no reason to know or anticipate that there would be any defects in \"Huggums\" tires.\n\n(D) Not recover, because Pedro was contributorily negligent in exceeding the speed limit.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": " Mac's is strictly liable to Pedro if Mac's sold a defective tire to Sandra. The question does not indicate what theory Pedro is using in his products liability action, so you should analyze the facts under a strict liability theory because it is the easiest theory for a plaintiff to establish. In a strict liability action based on a defective product, plaintiff must prove that (i) defendant was a commercial supplier owing a strict duty, (ii) the duty was breached because the product was supplied in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to users, (iii) the defect was the actual and proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries, and (iv) plaintiff suffered damages. Here, Mac's is a commercial supplier because it is a retailer of the tires, and therefore owes a strict duty to any user or foreseeable bystander; Pedro need not have purchased the tire from Mac's to recover. If the tire was defective when it was placed into commerce by the manufacturer, it would be unreasonably dangerous, i.e., dangerous beyond the expectation of the ordinary consumer, and Mac's would be in breach of its strict duty by selling it. Pedro can establish actual cause by showing that, but for the defect, the tire would not have suddenly blown out and the car would not have crashed. Proximate cause can be shown even if Sandra, the original purchaser, was negligent in not discovering the defect before selling the car to Pedro, because the negligent failure of an intermediary to discover a defect is not a superseding cause that would cut off the supplier's strict liability. Upon proof of the final element, damages, Pedro can recover from Mac's on a strict liability theory. (A) is incorrect because the fact that the tire blew out for no apparent reason is not sufficient to establish that the tire was defective when it was placed in commerce, which is a necessary element to impose strict liability on commercial suppliers. While the fact that the tire blew out suggests that it may have been defective, Pedro must present some evidence that the blowout was not caused by improper use or maintenance by either Sandra or him. (C) is incorrect because the care taken by Mac's in distributing tires from a reputable manufacturer, while it would be a defense in an action based on negligence, is not a defense in an action based on strict liability. Because strict liability may be one of the theories Pedro is using, $(\\mathrm{C})$ is not the best choice. Similarly, (D) is incorrect because even if Pedro's exceeding the speed limit was contributory negligence, it would not be a defense to a strict liability action in a jurisdiction retaining traditional contributory negligence doctrines. The fact that it was widely known in the tire industry that users would exceed posted speed limits indicates that Pedro's misuse of the tires was reasonably foreseeable; hence, it is a type of ordinary negligence that is not a defense in a strict liability action.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nTen years ago Gasmask Chemicals, a leading chemical manufacturer, decided that it needed a safe place to store byproduct waste from its manufacturing processes. Many of these byproducts were highly toxic; thus, Gasmask took great care in selecting a dump site. A highly reputable engineering company was hired and an exhaustive survey was performed. Finally the Temblor Canyon site was selected and the chemicals were stored there underground, using state-of-the-art techniques. Although the survey and attendant geological soundings were performed with consummate skill, the surveyors failed to discover a crack in the rock of the storage area that was too small for their instruments to detect. Over a period of years the chemicals began to seep through the crack and into the water table below the surface. Scientists in nearby Canyon City discovered that the city's water supply, all of which came from local wells that tapped into the water table, contained unacceptably high levels of chemical contaminants. Canyon City was required to spend $\\$ 5$ million on a complex filtration system to remove the dangerous chemicals from its water.\n\nCanyon City brought an action against Gasmask to recover the cost of building the filtration system. At the end of plaintiff's case establishing the above facts, Gasmask moved for a directed verdict.\n\nShould the court grant Gasmask's motion?\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Yes, because Canyon City has not presented any evidence that Gasmask breached a duty owed to the city.\n\n(B) Yes, if the evidence also established that Canyon City's water wells were drilled after Gasmask stored the chemicals.\n\n(C) No, if the court determines as a matter of law that the chemicals could not be stored without risk of serious harm no matter how much care Gasmask took.\n\n(D) No, because the trier of fact could determine that the chemicals could not be stored without risk of serious harm no matter how much care Gasmask took. \n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": " The court should deny Gasmask's motion if it determines that Gasmask's storage of chemicals was an abnormally dangerous activity, making Gasmask strictly liable for any harm caused by the chemicals. Canyon City can bring a private nuisance action against Gasmask for the substantial and unreasonable interference with the use of its water. Nuisances may be based on intent, negligence, or strict liability. A strict liability standard for engaging in an ultrahazardous or abnormally dangerous activity would apply where the activity (i) involves a risk of serious harm to persons or property; (ii) cannot be performed without risk of serious harm no matter how much care is taken; and (iii) is not a commonly engaged-in activity by persons in the community. Whether an activity is abnormally dangerous is a question of law that the court can decide on a motion for a directed verdict. Since Canyon City has presented no evidence of negligence on Gasmask's part, the only way that Canyon City can survive Gasmask's directed verdict motion is if the court finds that a strict liability standard applies, as suggested by (C). Choice (A) is incorrect. While no evidence of a breach of duty owed in negligence has been shown, Canyon City has presented enough evidence to establish breach of Gasmask's absolute duty to make the storage safe, if the court finds that Gasmask was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity. Canyon City has a cause of action for the breach of duty because its use of the water table adjacent to the storage site makes it a foreseeable plaintiff. (B) is incorrect because the fact that Canyon City drilled its wells after Gasmask stored its chemicals would not bar Canyon City from recovering and would have no effect on Gasmask's motion. This defense, called \"coming to the nuisance,\" is generally rejected by the courts. (D) is incorrect because, as discussed above, whether the elements making an activity abnormally dangerous are present is a question of law for the court rather than a question of fact.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Paul will prevail because Donnalou had the intent to commit a battery. To establish a prima facie case for battery, plaintiff must establish (i) an act by defendant that brings about harmful or offensive contact to the plaintiff's person, (ii) intent on the part of the defendant to bring about harmful or offensive contact to plaintiff's person, and (iii) causation. The harmful or offensive contact may be either direct or indirect; i.e., it is sufficient if defendant sets in motion a force that brings about harmful or offensive contact to the plaintiff's person. Here, all of the elements are present for a battery case against Donnalou. She acted by placing the drug in Paul's juice knowing that he would drink it. While she did not expect Paul to have a severe reaction to the drug, she did intend for it to affect him; i.e., she intended an offensive contact. Paul can establish causation not only for the initial reaction but also for the injuries from the car crash, because his ingestion of the drug was a substantial factor in bringing about those injuries. Thus, Paul can establish a prima facie case for battery against Donnalou, and Donnalou has no legitimate defenses that will prevent Paul from recovering for his injuries. (A) is incorrect because Dr. Pillpush's negligence does not break the causal connection between Paul's injuries from the auto accident and Donnalou's tortious act. Even though the accident would not have occurred but for the doctor's negligence, Donnalou's conduct was the primary factor in bringing about Paul's injuries. (B) is incorrect because Donnalou's lack of intent to harm Paul is irrelevant. As long as she intended that Paul ingest the drug, she intended an offensive contact. Thus, she is liable for battery even though she did not intend to harm Paul. (C) is incorrect. Unlike in negligence cases, the unforeseeability of additional forces that contribute to plaintiff's injury in an intentional tort case does not make them superseding forces that break the causal connection between the initial wrongful act and the ultimate injury.

A conversion is an interference with plaintiff's possessory rights in a chattel that is so serious as to warrant that the defendant pay full value for the chattel. Here, Randy's permission to use the boat had long since expired when the boat was severely damaged by the tree. While Randy would not have been responsible for that damage had it occurred while he was still rightfully in possession of the boat, the combination of the wrongful detention and the severe damage amounts to a conversion. Hence, Steve is entitled to recover damages for the fair market value of the boat at the time and place of conversion, in effect creating a forced sale of the boat. (A) and (B) are wrong because Steve can recover more than the actual damage to the boat and damages for dispossession; those remedies are appropriate for trespass to chattels, which is a less serious interference with plaintiff's possessory rights in a chattel. (B) and (D) are wrong because Steve is not liable for the damage to Randy's garden when he went to retrieve the boat. When a chattel is located on the land of a wrongdoer, the owner is privileged to enter upon the land and reclaim it in a reasonable manner. Unlike an entry onto the land of an innocent party, reasonable entry onto the land of a wrongdoer is completely privileged; i.e., the chattel owner does not have to pay for any actual damage caused by the entry.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " MMMA has breached its duty of care to Norton if it had reason to know of the danger. An owner or occupier of land owes a duty of care to make the premises reasonably safe for its invitees. For an owner of a place of public accommodation who gathers the public for profit, the duty extends to protecting its patrons from injury from third persons where the owner knew or should have known of the danger. Both Martha and Norton are business invitees of Modern Mall because Martha is a potential customer of the business, even though she was not planning to buy anything, and Norton is accompanying Martha. Thus, if MMMA had reason to know of any danger to Norton from criminal acts of third persons, MMMA has breached its duty to Norton. Norton should have little difficulty establishing actual cause, proximate cause, and damages, the other elements of his prima facie case. (Assuming that MMMA had reason to know of the danger of a criminal act against Norton, the act is foreseeable and thus not a superseding intervening force that would cut off the causal connection.) Hence, MMMA is likely to be found liable to Norton. (A) is incorrect because owners of land, even those opening their premises to the public for profit, are not strictly liable to their customers for injuries from third persons. MMMA must have been negligent for it to be liable to Norton. (C) is incorrect because a criminal act of a third person is a superseding force only if it is not foreseeable. If MMMA had reason to know of the danger of a criminal act against Norton, it was negligent in failing to take steps to eliminate the danger, and this negligence created a foreseeable risk that Norton would be harmed by a third person. (D) is incorrect because Norton was accompanying Martha, who was a potential customer of the business, and is therefore an invitee as to all areas of the mall that were open to the public, including its restrooms.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " The court should grant Shortstop's motion for a directed verdict because Jason has not established a prima facie case of negligence on Shortstop's part. Jason has established that Shortstop owed a duty to him and that he has suffered harm from the fire caused by the short in the wiring. However, he has not established that Shortstop breached any duty to him. While breach of duty is ordinarily a question for the trier of fact, plaintiff's failure to offer any evidence on that element of the prima facie case will permit a directed verdict for defendant. Under certain circumstances, the fact that a particular injury occurred may itself establish or tend to establish a breach of duty owed, permitting the trier of fact to infer defendant's liability. This is the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur (\"the thing speaks for itself\"). However, for the doctrine to apply, plaintiff must show that (i) the accident causing his injury is the type that would not normally occur unless someone was negligent; (ii) the negligence was attributable to defendant; and (iii) the injury was not attributable to plaintiff. The second requirement can often be satisfied by showing that the instrumentality causing the injury was in the exclusive control of the defendant. Here, however, the wiring was exposed to work done by other contractors on an immediately adjacent chimney and hot water pipe, and in putting up the walls, and Jason has offered no evidence that the cut in the outer sheath of the wiring was present when Shortstop finished its work. Instead, the fact that the wiring had been approved by the building inspector suggests that the wiring was intact when Shortstop finished. Given these facts, Jason has not presented evidence that the negligence was attributable to the defendant. Since res ipsa loquitur does not apply and no other evidence of breach of duty was established, Shortstop's motion for a directed verdict should be granted. (C) is therefore correct and (A) and (B) are incorrect. (B) is also incorrect because Jason's motion for a directed verdict would be denied even if he had established res ipsa loquitur. Establishing res ipsa loquitur merely creates a permissible inference of negligence; it does not create a presumption of negligence. Where the res ipsa loquitur element has been proved, plaintiff has established a prima facie breach of duty on defendant's part and no directed verdict may be given for defendant. However, it does not require defendant to present evidence to rebut a presumption. The trier of fact is free to accept the inference of negligence that has been created and find for the plaintiff or reject the inference of negligence and find for the defendant, even if the defendant offers no other evidence on the issue. Thus, the court would not grant Jason's motion for a directed verdict even if he had established res ipsa loquitur. (D) is incorrect because Shortstop is not strictly liable for the short in the wiring. Jason's failure to offer some evidence of negligence on the part of Shortstop will allow Shortstop to prevail.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " MMMA has breached its duty of care to Norton if it had reason to know of the danger. An owner or occupier of land owes a duty of care to make the premises reasonably safe for its invitees. For an owner of a place of public accommodation who gathers the public for profit, the duty extends to protecting its patrons from injury from third persons where the owner knew or should have known of the danger. Both Martha and Norton are business invitees of Modern Mall because Martha is a potential customer of the business, even though she was not planning to buy anything, and Norton is accompanying Martha. Thus, if MMMA had reason to know of any danger to Norton from criminal acts of third persons, MMMA has breached its duty to Norton. Norton should have little difficulty establishing actual cause, proximate cause, and damages, the other elements of his prima facie case. (Assuming that MMMA had reason to know of the danger of a criminal act against Norton, the act is foreseeable and thus not a superseding intervening force that would cut off the causal connection.) Hence, MMMA is likely to be found liable to Norton. (A) is incorrect because owners of land, even those opening their premises to the public for profit, are not strictly liable to their customers for injuries from third persons. MMMA must have been negligent for it to be liable to Norton. (C) is incorrect because a criminal act of a third person is a superseding force only if it is not foreseeable. If MMMA had reason to know of the danger of a criminal act against Norton, it was negligent in failing to take steps to eliminate the danger, and this negligence created a foreseeable risk that Norton would be harmed by a third person. (D) is incorrect because Norton was accompanying Martha, who was a potential customer of the business, and is therefore an invitee as to all areas of the mall that were open to the public, including its restrooms.\n\n",

Mrs. Wealthy was an affluent and socially prominent widow who resided in The Watervliet. The next day Jeffries obtained a key to Mrs. Wealthy's apartment and gave the key to Garth. Garth handed Jeffries the $\\$ 250$ in cash. Jeffries believed that Garth planned to use the key to take valuables from Mrs. Wealthy's apartment.

It turned out that the Belchfire had been very recently reported as stolen. Doofus was unable to produce satisfactory registration papers and was arrested for car theft. At the police station, Smith gave Doofus the standard Miranda warnings, and Doofus agreed to answer Smith's questions regarding a local \"chop-shop\" network, which arranged for the theft of expensive automobiles so that they could be cut up for parts. After a while, Jones suggested, \"Let's break for lunch.\" He and Smith escorted Doofus to a nearby cafeteria. During the course of their lunch, which lasted about an hour, Smith noticed that Doofus, who was otherwise rather shabbily dressed, was wearing an obviously expensive \"Xelor\" watch. Upon their return to the station, and without giving any new Miranda warnings, Smith resumed interrogation of Doofus. She asked Doofus about a recent home invasion in the swank \"Notting Hill\" neighborhood, where a quantity of valuable jewelry, including a \"Xelor\" watch, was taken. Doofus thereupon confessed to the home invasion, and was indicted on the home invasion charge, a felony under the jurisdiction's modern criminal code.\n\nIf Doofus files an appropriate motion to prevent the confession from being admitted at his trial, Doofus will probably:\n(A) Succeed, because the police did not repeat the Miranda warnings before questioning Doofus about another crime.\n(B) Succeed, because the police acted in a custodial setting.\n(C) Fail, because Doofus was not in custody on a home invasion charge.\n(D) Fail, because the original Miranda warn- ings given Doofus were sufficient under the circumstances. \n\n\\section{Question 13}\n\nDenise, a 12-year-old girl, entered a grocery store.

The \"Huggums\" tires were manufactured by Kimbo Tire and Rubber Company, a reputable tire manufacturer. It was widely known in the tire industry that purchasers of tires would, on occasion, exceed posted speed limits, and therefore tires were designed to perform at speeds higher than the maximum speed of 65 m.p.h. allowable in most states. Sandra was a safe and careful driver who never exceeded the speed limit.\n\nWhen Sandra's car had 32,000 miles on it, she sold the car to Pedro. Pedro immediately took the car on a 500-mile trip to visit his sister. During the course of the journey, Pedro often drove his car 10 m.p.h. over the posted limit of 65 m.p.h. As Pedro approached his destination, he was driving 73 m.p.h. on smooth pavement. Suddenly his left front tire blew out for no apparent reason. The car went out of control, crashed into another vehicle, and Pedro was severely injured.\n\nIf Pedro sues Mac's for his injuries in a jurisdiction retaining traditional contributory negligence rules, Pedro should:\n\n(A) Recover, because the tire blew out for no apparent reason.\n\n(B) Recover, if the tire was defective when it left Kimbo's manufacturing plant.\n\n(C) Not recover, if Mac's had no reason to know or anticipate that there would be any defects in \"Huggums\" tires.\n\n(D) Not recover, because Pedro was contributorily negligent in exceeding the speed limit.\n\n\\section{Question 13}\n\nTen years ago Gasmask Chemicals, a leading chemical manufacturer, decided that it needed a safe place to store byproduct waste from its manufacturing processes. Many of these byproducts were highly toxic; thus, Gasmask took great care in selecting a dump site. A highly reputable engineering company was hired and an exhaustive survey was performed. Finally the Temblor Canyon site was selected and the chemicals were stored there underground, using state-of-the-art techniques. Although the survey and attendant geological soundings were performed with consummate skill, the surveyors failed to discover a crack in the rock of the storage area that was too small for their instruments to detect. Over a period of years the chemicals began to seep through the crack and into the water table below the surface. Scientists in nearby Canyon City discovered that the city's water supply, all of which came from local wells that tapped into the water table, contained unacceptably high levels of chemical contaminants. Canyon City was required to spend $\\$ 5$ million on a complex filtration system to remove the dangerous chemicals from its water.\n\nCanyon City brought an action against Gasmask to recover the cost of building the filtration system. At the end of plaintiff's case establishing the above facts, Gasmask moved for a directed verdict.\n\nShould the court grant Gasmask's motion?\n\n(A) Yes, because Canyon City has not presented any evidence that Gasmask breached a duty owed to the city.\n\n(B) Yes, if the evidence also established that Canyon City's water wells were drilled after Gasmask stored the chemicals.\n\n(C) No, if the court determines as a matter of law that the chemicals could not be stored without risk of serious harm no matter how much care Gasmask took.\n\n(D) No, because the trier of fact could determine that the chemicals could not be stored without risk of serious harm no matter how much care Gasmask took. \n\n\\section{TORTS}\n\n\\section{Question 14}\n\nNeither the legislature nor the courts of State Yellow have abolished the common law tort defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk. However, the State Yellow legislature decided it was time to take steps against all forms of drug abuse and passed the Omnibus Anti-Drug Act (\"OADA\"). One of the OADA provisions forbade the selling of airplane glue to anyone under the age of 18 except in small quantities in prepackaged model kits. Violation of the statute was penalized by fines or, in cases of multiple violations, possible imprisonment. OADA also required that all elementary and secondary schools licensed by the state provide comprehensive drug education programs.\n\nPrimrose was a 14-year-old resident of State Yellow. Primrose had experienced the drug education program in his school, as mandated by OADA. One of the units in the program covered the dangers of glue sniffing. Primrose understood the anti-drug instruction, but he enjoyed the \"high\" he got from sniffing glue when he constructed model airplanes, and he wanted to experience more of it. He went to Daffodil's Hobby \\& Craft Shop to purchase a large tube of airplane glue. Daffodil, sole proprietor of the hobby shop, sold the large tube of glue to Primrose. Primrose went home, hid in the garage, and sniffed the glue. His parents found Primrose in a coma on the garage floor. Although Primrose will survive, physicians have told his parents that he suffered permanent brain damage from sniffing the glue.\n\nOn Primrose's behalf, the parents filed suit against Daffodil, which should result in a verdict: (A) For Daffodil, because Primrose was aware of the danger when he sniffed the glue.\n\n(B) For Daffodil, because Primrose is not a member of the class of persons meant to be protected by OADA.\n\n(C) For Primrose, because Daffodil violated OADA when he sold the glue to Primrose.\n\n(D) For Primrose, unless Primrose could reasonably have been mistaken for an 18 year-old by Daffodil.\n\n\n\n\\section{Questions 15-16} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nPluto, Donald, and Mickey were involved in a three-car accident. Pluto was badly injured and suffered $\\$ 100,000$ worth of damages. The jurisdiction in which the accident took place has a \"pure\" comparative negligence statute. Pluto filed suit against Donald for his injuries. The trier of fact determined that Pluto was $30 \\%$ at fault, Donald was $30 \\%$ at fault, and Mickey was $40 \\%$ at fault.\n\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": " Hospital Suppliers would be liable to Paul in a strict products liability action if it could have installed a safety latch on the footrest without incurring unreasonable additional cost or unreasonably impairing the table's utility. Under section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, a commercial supplier of a product may be liable to any foreseeable plaintiff who was injured by a product that was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to users. In making this determination, many courts have considered one of the principal factors to be whether the product could be modified to make it less dangerous without making it unreasonably expensive or without unreasonably impairing its utility, which is the condition stated in choice (B). (A) is not as good an answer as (B) because the fact that the $\\mathrm{x}$-ray table is defective does not establish by itself a breach of the manufacturer's duty.

        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": " Donald is jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of Pluto's damages that Pluto himself was not responsible for, but can obtain contribution from Mickey in proportion to Mickey's fault. Comparative negligence jurisdictions allow a plaintiff to recover some percentage of his damages even though he was contributorily negligent in causing the accident. \"Pure\" comparative negligence allows a plaintiff some recovery no matter how great his negligence was. Most comparative negligence jurisdictions retain the doctrine of joint and several liability, which makes each of several tortfeasors liable to the plaintiff for the entire amount of damages to which the plaintiff is entitled. However, if one tortfeasor does have to pay the plaintiff the entire judgment, the rule of contribution allows the paying tortfeasor to recover the excess over his share from the nonpaying tortfeasor. If contribution is based on comparative fault, the nonpaying tortfeasor is required to contribute an amount in proportion to his relative fault. Here, Pluto suffered $\\$ 100,000$ in damages but was $30 \\%$ at fault, allowing him a net recovery of $\\$ 70,000-\\$ 100,000$ minus $30 \\%(\\$ 30,000)$. He can recover the entire $\\$ 70,000$ from Donald because the jurisdiction retains the doctrine of joint and several liability. However, under a system of contribution based on comparative fault, Donald can compel Mickey to pay him $\\$ 40,000$ as contribution because Mickey was $40 \\%$ at fault in causing the $\\$ 100,000$ of damages incurred by Pluto. (B) is incorrect. If Donald did only pay $\\$ 40,000$ to Pluto, he could compel Mickey to pay $\\$ 10,000$ as contribution (because Donald's proportional share of the damages is only $\\$ 30,000$ ). However, because Donald is jointly and severally liable, Pluto can collect up to $\\$ 70,000$ from him. (C) is incorrect because Donald is liable for more than his proportional share of the damages if the jurisdiction provides for joint and several liability. (D) is incorrect because a pure comparative negligence jurisdiction allows recovery no matter how great plaintiff's negligence is compared with defendant's. (D) probably also would be incorrect in a \"partial\" comparative negligence jurisdiction that only allows plaintiff to recover if he is less at fault than defendant. Most of these jurisdictions use a \"combined comparison\" approach when several tortfeasors are involved, comparing plaintiff's negligence with the total negligence of all of the defendants combined. Because Pluto was only $30 \\%$ at fault and Donald and Mickey together were $70 \\%$ at fault, Pluto could recover against Donald even in a partial comparative negligence jurisdiction.\n\n",

Oswald knew of the building's condition, but he did not want to spend the money needed to repair it and hoped that the Hooverville Redevelopment Commission would want his land to build a shopping mall.\n\nTimmy was a driver for U-Pump-It Tanker Lines, a concern that operated tanker trucks that delivered gasoline to filling stations. U-PumpIt's rules required drivers to park only in legally designated parking areas. After completing his deliveries for the day in Hooverville, Timmy stopped for a cup of coffee. He did not want to spend time trying to find a parking place on a side street, so he parked in front of Oswald's building, which was located on a through street. The area in front of Oswald's building was clearly marked, \"No Parking At Any Time.\" Timmy walked to the Emporium Restaurant, where he ordered coffee and the daily special.\n\nHooverville was located in an area subject to minor earthquake activity. Just as Timmy began his lunch, a quake jolted Hooverville. The quake was not strong enough to cause damage to structurally sound buildings, but was sufficient to cause the walls of Oswald's building to collapse. The building fell on top of the U-Pump-It truck, causing the truck to roll over on its side. Gasoline leaked from the truck and began streaming down the street. Elvira, a pedestrian walking two blocks away, lit a cigarette and casually tossed a match in the street. The stream of gasoline had just reached that street and the match caused the gasoline to ignite. The flames spread to a nearby commercial building. An explosion occurred, causing many windows in a neighboring apartment building to be blown inward. Flying glass was propelled into Bonnie's apartment.

        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  If U-Pump-It prevails, it will be because the court follows the Cardozo approach to duty questions. Under Cardozo's approach in Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad, a plaintiff can recover for the defendant's breach of duty only if she can establish that a reasonable person would have foreseen a risk of injury to her in the circumstances; i.e., that she was located in a foreseeable zone of danger. Here, even assuming that Timmy breached a duty by parking his truck on the street, Bonnie was not within a foreseeable zone of danger and would not be able to recover damages under this view. (B) is incorrect because Timmy's stopping for a cup of coffee after making deliveries does not take him outside the scope of the employment relationship. Hence, if Timmy breached a duty to Bonnie, U-Pump-It would be vicariously liable for her injuries. (C) is incorrect because even if Oswald were a legal (proximate) cause of Bonnie's injuries, that would not preclude Timmy and U-Pump-It from being a legal cause as well. (D) is wrong because the fact that Timmy violated company rules by parking on the street would not prevent U-Pump-It from being liable for Timmy's actions, because he was still acting within the scope of his employment relationship.\n\n",

        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Olivia will recover the fair market value of the machine because Scarlet is liable for conversion. Conversion is the intentional interference with the plaintiff's right of possession in the chattel that is serious enough to warrant that the defendant pay the full value of the chattel. Conversion will be found if the defendant was using the chattel without permission and it was accidentally damaged, as in this case. The remedy for conversion is the fair market value of the chattel at the time and place of conversion. Thus, (B) is correct and (A) is incorrect. (C) is incorrect because that would be the remedy for trespass to chattels, which is a less serious interference than conversion. Here, an unauthorized use that resulted in damages equaling almost half the chattel's original cost is too serious an interference in nature and consequences to be only trespass to chattel. (D) is incorrect because Scarlet's lending the sewing machine without permission satisfies the intent requirement. Even though the damage was accidental, Scarlet is liable for conversion.\n\n",

Although Madonna had heard Presley say he had bought Rockacre, Madonna thought $\\$ 5,000$ was a terrific price for the property.

        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Under a race-notice statute such as the one in this question, a subsequent purchaser is protected only if he purchases without notice of prior conveyances and records first. However, even though Madonna had notice of Presley's deed and was therefore not a bona fide purchaser, and could not have prevailed against Presley, that does not mean that a bona fide purchaser from her would not prevail against Presley. Fats was a subsequent bona fide purchaser from Madonna and recorded before Presley. Thus, Fats would prevail over Presley. Chubby, who had notice of Presley's deed when he subsequently acquired his deed from Fats, will also prevail over Presley. This is due to the \"shelter doctrine,\" which is applied to the recording acts. Under that doctrine, once a bona fide purchaser enters the chain of events, she can subsequently deed the land to a party who had notice of the prior deed and that party is also accorded the status of a bona fide purchaser. Thus, once Fats, a bona fide purchaser, enters the picture and gets the protection of the act, he can sell to Chubby, who gets the protection of the act even though he purchased with notice. Chubby comes under the shelter doctrine. The theory behind the shelter doctrine is that it extends full protection to bona fide purchasers in that it does not limit their ability to market the property. Otherwise, if they could not sell to parties with notice, their ability to market the property would be impaired. The exception to the shelter doctrine is that it does not apply to the first purchaser with notice-Madonna. Thus, if Fats had subsequently sold to Madonna, she would not have been accorded the status of a bona fide purchaser. The reason for the exception is obvious-to \n\n",

        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Although the First and Fourteenth Amendments severely limit the states' right to regulate public speech, reasonable regulations based on time, place, and manner are constitutionally permissible. (D) is thus wrong. (A) is wrong because the fact that the civic center is a place normally used for demonstrations of this type does not bar the city from restricting the demonstration; that is exactly why the city sought to impose certain limitations on these demonstrations. (B) is also incorrect, because a municipality does have the limited right to place certain limitations on a citizen's right of free speech in these circumstances, even when there is absolutely no reason to believe that the demonstration will be anything but peaceful and quiet. However, any such regulation by the city cannot be substantially overbroad (e.g., censor protected speech) or vague (i.e., be so unclear as to what is prohibited that a demonstrator is required to censor himself). The statute's provisions for terminating a parade and arresting demonstrators are too overbroad and vague to meet any legitimate state purpose.

        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  June will win because consideration generally is required for modification of a contract, and Carol's preexisting debt cannot serve as valid consideration. Consideration generally is necessary to modify a contract. Payment of a smaller sum than due will not be sufficient consideration for a promise by a creditor to discharge a debt unless the consideration is in some way new or different (e.g., payment before maturity or to one other than the creditor) or the amount of debt is subject to an honest dispute (and so the parties are giving up the right to litigate the amount, which is consideration sufficient to support a modification in and of itself). Here, nothing indicates that Carol gave anything new or different in exchange for the lower payment. Moreover, the amount was not in dispute. Therefore, there is no consideration supporting the modification, so the modification is unenforceable. (Note that even if the money was owed on a contract under the U.C.C., which permits modification without consideration, the modification still would be unenforceable because the modification must still have a good faith purpose and nothing in the facts indicates that the modification was made in good faith.) (B) is incorrect because the agreement was not supported by consideration. As discussed above, consideration is required to support Carol and June's agreement. Payment by Carol of a smaller sum than due is not sufficient consideration. Therefore, June is not bound by the agreement, and she may recover the $\\$ 10,000$. (C) is incorrect because accord and satisfaction require that the amount of the debt be in dispute. A contract may be discharged by an accord (an agreement, supported by consideration, to accept some other performance in lieu of the performance required under the existing contract) and satisfaction (the performance of the accord agreement). A partial payment of an original debt will suffice for an accord and satisfaction where there is a \"bona fide dispute\" as to the claim. However, because the amount of Carol's debt was not in dispute, her payment of $\\$ 80,000$ was not valid consideration for an accord agreement. Therefore, Carol's original debt has not been discharged by an accord and satisfaction, and June may recover the $\\$ 10,000$. (D) is incorrect because it is irrelevant. A contract can be modified before or after the date of performance if the modification is supported by consideration. As discussed above, Carol's payment of a preexisting debt is not valid consideration for the new agreement. Therefore, June is entitled to the $\\$ 10,000$ owed from the original contract, even though she agreed after the due date to settle for $\\$ 80,000$.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nParafun, Inc. manufactured and sold parachutes for use by sport skydivers. The corporation's product development committee selected a design for a parachute submitted by Silk, one of Parafun's three professional designers. The chute was placed on the market, with the warning, \"This parachute should be discarded after 150 jumps.\" Parafun's market researchers had established that the usual practice among sport skydivers was to discard a parachute after 100 jumps.\n\nAfter the design had been approved and the product was successfully manufactured and marketed, Silk took several of the parachutes to an independent stress analysis laboratory. The scientists tested the chutes and concluded that there was a $1 \\%$ failure rate on the chutes for jumps 100 through 150 , because the center of the parachute might tend to collapse because of a design defect. Silk did not report this problem to his superiors at Parafun, because he feared he would be fired.\n\nSeveral months after Silk received the testing report, Airborne, a sport skydiver, used one of the chutes designed by Silk and manufactured and sold by Parafun. Airborne's use was the 115 th jump for the chute. When Airborne leaped from the airplane, the chute opened properly, but halfway down, the center of the chute collapsed inward. Airborne hurtled to the ground to his death. An investigation established that Silk knew of the design defect.\n\nIf Parafun is charged with manslaughter in a common law jurisdiction, the verdict should be: \n\n\\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Guilty, because Silk was Parafun's employee and he designed the instrumentality of death.\n\n(B) Guilty, because Airborne died as a result of the failure of a product manufactured and sold by Parafun.\n\n(C) Not guilty, because a corporation cannot be found guilty of manslaughter.\n\n(D) Not guilty, because there was only a $1 \\%$ chance of parachute failure.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Parafun will not be guilty of manslaughter because at common law a corporation is not responsible for the criminal acts of its employees. Common law took the position that since the corporation had no mind, it could not form the mens rea necessary for a traditional crime, and since the corporation could not be imprisoned, there was no criminal liability imposed on the corporation for the common law crimes committed by its agents. While the common law rule has been changed by statute in many jurisdictions, the question does not indicate the existence of such a statute. Absent a statute, Parafun will not be guilty of manslaughter. (A) is wrong because, as stated above, at common law a corporation would not be liable for a common law crime. In addition, at common law an employer is not responsible for the unauthorized criminal conduct of his employees. (B) is wrong. Even if criminal liability could be imposed on Parafun for the crimes of Silk, there would have to be a showing that Silk was at least reckless in causing the death. (B) seems to impose liability on Parafun without regard to the mental state of Silk. (D) is wrong. The fact that there was only a $1 \\%$ chance of parachute failure would be a factor for the jury to consider in deciding whether a person acted \"recklessly\"; it would not as a matter of law negate criminal liability.\n\n",

(D) Not prevail, because Farley did not make any specific covenants with regard to the sale of this house.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  There are many types of deeds that can be used to convey real property, some of which contain no covenants at all, such as quitclaim deeds. Thus, if Farley can show that the power of attorney did not include the power to convey a deed containing covenants, Glenda would not prevail. Thus, (A) is wrong. (D) is incorrect because although Farley did not make any specific covenants, Milton did. Farley will be held to those covenants if it is found that the power of attorney was intended to grant Milton the power to convey a deed containing covenants. (B) is incorrect because Glenda could have a claim for breach of the covenant of title and right to convey even if Farley's former wife did not bring a claim against her.

        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  This answer can best be understood by examining the permissible questions first. (A) asks about a prior conviction for forgery. Under Federal Rule 609 , prior convictions of crimes requiring proof or admission of an act of dishonesty or false statement may be inquired into if they are less than 10 years old. This crime is one of dishonesty and is not too old; therefore, the question is proper. (B) is also a proper question. It goes to bias, which is always a permissible line of inquiry. (D) relates to prior bad acts for which there is no conviction. Federal Rule 608(b) permits crossexamination concerning prior bad acts if, in the discretion of the court, they are probative of truthfulness. Cheating a business partner is dishonest, and Winston is a witness not a party; therefore, this question is proper. That leaves alternative (C). If the ability to observe, relate, or recall were at issue, then this question could be a permissible line of inquiry, especially since Winston is not a party and is not likely to be prejudiced by the question. On the other hand, the probative value of the other questions is obvious. Since the other questions are all obviously right, this is the one most likely to be ruled improper.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nArthur's hobby was restoring classic cars, and he frequently attended shows at which people with similar interests would gather to display their handiwork, compare techniques and information, and view products of manufacturers who catered to such hobbyists. At one such show, Arthur was examining a 1947 Pontiac \"Stretch\" Roadster when the owner, who was standing nearby, indicated that he was trying to sell the car. Bud, who stated that he had restored the Pontiac himself, told Arthur that (I) the car was restored using nothing but genuine Pontiac parts or parts that Bud had handmade himself. He said that (II) \"this is the finest restoration of a 1947 'Stretch' Roadster in the United States, and one of the two best in the world.\"' As they were discussing price, Bud pointed out that (III) \"this car has the original 'rearing horse' grille that was installed by the dealer on 1947 'Stretch' Roadsters.\" Arthur agreed to purchase the car for a considerable sum, and had it transported to his home. Later, he discovered that Bud had not been entirely truthful about the restoration. In his action for deceit, Arthur establishes that Bud knew, when he made statements I, II, and III, above, that each was false. Assuming that all the other elements of deceit are proven, which of the three statements will support Arthur's claims?\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  I only.\n(B) I and II.\n(C) I and III.\n(D) I, II, and III.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Arthur's statements I and III were false representations of material facts and therefore actionable. To establish a prima facie case of intentional misrepresentation (deceit), a plaintiff must establish (i) a misrepresentation made by the defendant, (ii) scienter, (iii) an intent to induce plaintiff's reliance on the misrepresentation, (iv) causation (i.e., actual reliance), (v) justifiable reliance, and (vi) damages. Usually, there is a requirement that the false representation be of a material past or present fact; whether the restoration was accomplished with genuine or handmade parts (statement I), or whether it contained original equipment (statement III), are statements of fact that would be very material to a potential buyer of classic cars. Hence, assuming that all the other elements of deceit are proved, both of these statements can be the basis of Arthur's claim. Statement II, on the other hand, will not support Arthur's misrepresentation claim because he cannot show justifiable reliance on the statement. As a general matter, reliance on false statements of opinion, value, or quality will be viewed as unjustified. Bud's claims that this is the \"finest\" restoration and \"one of the two best\" are statements of opinion as to quality. An exception to this rule might apply if Arthur were purchasing the car to enter into competition, or if Bud had superior knowledge of the subject matter, but here there is no indication what Arthur's plans are, and Arthur's experience with classic cars would make his reliance on Bud's opinion unjustified. Thus, (C) is correct; only statements I and III will support Arthur's claims.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nAstro developed a new synthetic liquid that could safely double the output of electrical power plants. He built a manufacturing plant unlike any other in the world capable of producing this liquid. A byproduct of the production of the liquid was a hazardous chemical that was not biodegradable in the environment. Astro buried the waste chemical in a depression on his land. Before doing so, Astro secured expert opinion, based on soil analysis, that led him reasonably to believe that the earth beneath the disposal site was impermeable, and that there was no danger of contaminating the underground waters. The chemical, nonetheless, seeped through the underlying soil strata, and was carried by the flow of percolating water to a well used by Herder to water his sheep, which he raised on an adjacent property. The chemical rendered the water in the well unfit for consumption by sheep.\n\nIf Herder's sheep were harmed by drinking from the contaminated well, and Herder asserts a claim against Astro for damages to the sheep, which of the following facts, if established, would best aid Astro's case? Assume that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules.\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Many companies converted their power plants so that they could utilize the synthetic liquid developed by Astro.\n\n(B) Herder did not do what a reasonable person would have done to prevent harm to his sheep after he learned that the well was contaminated. (C) If he had exercised ordinary care, Herder would have discovered the contamination before his sheep were harmed.\n\n(D) Astro's plant was in place and in operation before Herder purchased his property.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Under the \"avoidable consequences\" rule, a plaintiff has a duty to mitigate damages to avoid further injuries from the defendant's conduct. Since Herder's property was damaged in this situation, Herder's claim would be based on strict liability. As such, simple contributory negligence would not be a good defense in jurisdictions following traditional contributory negligence rules. (C) is therefore incorrect. But if the plaintiff discovers the existence of the danger and fails to act reasonably to prevent further harm from occurring, the defendant would have a good defense. (A) is incorrect because there is no balancing of utility and risk where ultrahazardous activities are involved. (D) is incorrect because Herder would have had to have known of and appreciated the risk involved when he purchased the property to constitute assumption of the risk.

A contract was duly entered into between the state and the corporation. Before LawComp could begin installation of the necessary equipment in state offices, it was revealed that Westcoast's state university system had exhausted its budgeted resources and would not be able to operate without additional money. The legislature then repealed the statute authorizing use of the computer legal service and allocated the funds thereby released to the university.\n\nLawComp brings an action against the state to enforce the contract.

        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Invalid, because it violates the constitu- tional prohibition against impairment of contracts.\n(B) Valid, because the legislature has constitu- tional power to repeal its own enactments.\n(C) Invalid, because the state is equitably estopped to renounce a valid bid it has accepted.\n(D) Valid, because the sovereign may not constitutionally be sued without its own consent.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  As a general rule, a state may not retroactively alter a contract to which it is a party. While that prohibition is not absolute, legislation that reduces the contractual burdens on the state will be strictly scrutinized. Here, the legislature is simply making a choice about how to distribute resources to meet competing needs, and the impairment will be stricken. A state may repeal its own enactments, but may not do so when repeal violates a constitutional prohibition. Thus, (B) is incorrect. Sovereign immunity is not a constitutional doctrine, nor is equitable estoppel, except as subsumed in the Due Process Clause in a manner not as directly applicable under these circumstances as the impairment of contracts doctrine.

        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Unconstitutional, because it violates the First Amendment's prohibition of government infringement of the right of free speech. (B) Unconstitutional, because it prevents religious organizations from obtaining contributions from their members, and thus interferes with the free exercise of religion.\n\n(C) Constitutional, because it represents a reasonable balancing of the state's police power interest in protecting its citizens from fraud and annoyance against the right of people to seek charitable contributions.\n\n(D) Constitutional, because preventing fraud in the solicitation for charitable contributions is a compelling interest.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  The ordinance is probably unconstitutional because it violates free speech rights under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has held that a charitable appeal for funds involves a variety of speech interests protected by the First Amendment. In one case, an ordinance that prohibited door-to-door solicitation by organizations that did not use at least $75 \\%$ of their receipts for charitable purposes was struck down by the Court. The present ordinance would probably run afoul of the same rule, since in effect it prohibits all charitable solicitation absent relatively burdensome compliance with its registration provisions. The ordinance is also vulnerable because it limits the right of solicitation to those who belong to \"a recognized charitable organization.\" (B), while a correct statement of law, does not apply in these circumstances. The question is directed toward the challenge George would mount, not one that a religious organization might pursue. (C) is incorrect. Since the First Amendment rights at issue here are fundamental, a \"reasonable balance\" is not enough; the government ordinance is a direct, content-based regulation, and will be subjected to strict scrutiny. (D) is incorrect because even if the prevention of fraud is a compelling state interest, the statute is not narrowly tailored to achieve that interest, which is required under the strict scrutiny standard.\n\n",

Beneath the passenger seat he found Dolly's purse. He opened the purse and found a plastic zip-lock bag containing a small amount of marijuana. Dolly was charged with possession of drugs. At Dolly's trial, her attorney moved to suppress the admission of the marijuana seized from Dolly's purse into evidence.\n\nShould the court rule favorably on the motion?\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Yes, because when conducting a search incident to an arrest the police may not open a closed container. (B) Yes, because the police lacked probable cause to search Dolly's purse.\n\n(C) No, because the search was incident to the lawful arrest of Marty.\n\n(D) No, because the marijuana was discovered during the course of a valid inventory search.\n\n\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "(A)  The motion to suppress the evidence will be granted because the police did not have probable cause to search the car. When the police place the driver of an automobile under arrest, there are a number of alternatives with respect to a search of the car: (i) Regardless of the crime for which the defendant is arrested, the police can search the entire passenger area of the car as a search incident to an arrest. However, the search incident to an arrest must be conducted at the time of the arrest. (ii) If the police have probable cause to search the car-i.e., reasonable grounds for believing that a legitimate item of seizure is in the car-a search of the entire car can be made without a warrant. The search based on probable cause can be made at the time of the arrest or at a later time. (iii) If the police take the car under their control for an administrative reason (such as to get the car off the highway), they can \"inventory\" the items in the car under certain circumstances. In this question, the search of the car at the police station would have been valid $i f$ the police had probable cause to search the car. The question does not provide any facts that could form the basis for probable cause to search. Thus, the motion to suppress will be granted because of the lack of probable cause. (A) is wrong for two reasons: The search could not be justified as a search incident to an arrest since the arrest had been completed. Also, when conducting a valid search incident to an arrest, the police may open up a closed container within the arrestee's \"wingspan.\" (C) is wrong because, as stated, a search incident to an arrest must occur at the time of the arrest. (D) is wrong. The police can conduct an administrative inventory if the car has been impounded by the police, and the police are, in fact, conducting an inventory of the items in the car. In this question, the car had not been impounded by the police, nor would it need to be since Dolly could drive it home.

        "Explanation": "(A)  It seems clear that Clara intended her grandchildren to inherit the property at some time, and that the only thing she desired was that Truman be able to live there as long as he wanted. Since Truman could conceivably live there all his life, this devise would be deemed a life estate in Truman, with a vested remainder in Sam. Sam's interest would, however, be subject to open (partial defeasance) since it was possible that Truman could have other children. At Truman's death, Sam's interest became indefeasibly vested. (A) is incorrect because the language of the will clearly does not express an intent that Truman take a fee simple absolute. (B) is incorrect because however many children Truman may have, his life would be the measuring life, and the grandchildren would inherit upon his death.

        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "(A)  To prevail, Prole must show evidence of actual injury. When a defamatory statement involves a matter of public concern, the plaintiff must provide competent evidence of actual injury (i.e., presumed damages are not permitted absent a showing of knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth). Actual injury is not limited to out-of-pocket loss; it may include impairment of reputation, personal humiliation, and mental anguish. Here, the reasons for the firing of the chief operating officer of a town's largest employer, and the financial health of that employer, are matters of public concern for the readership of the Middletown Herald. Hence, Prole will have to prove actual injury to prevail. (A) is incorrect because pecuniary damages are not necessary in libel cases.

He files suit in the federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment that would prevent the Army from requiring him to retire before age 75 .\n\nPortman's strongest argument in support of his contention that the statute's provisions regarding civil service employees of the armed services are invalid is that this provision:\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Denies him the privileges and immunities of national citizenship. (B) Denies him a property right without just compensation.\n\n(C) Is invidious discrimination on the basis of age in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n(D) Is not within the enumerated powers of Congress under Article I, Section 8.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  The strongest possible argument here is (C) because equal protection claims are made against the federal government pursuant to the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court has held that this provision implicitly includes a requirement for equal protection. Although Portman has little chance of prevailing because only a rational basis test is used for age discrimination claims, this answer is the only possible basis for challenging the law. (A) is wrong because both constitutional provisions referring to privileges and immunities apply to state government conduct and are never used against the federal government. The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall deny any citizen the privileges or immunities of national citizenship. Article IV provides that no state shall deny citizens of other states the privileges and immunities it accords its own citizens. (B) is wrong because a \"just compensation\" claim will only provide him compensation for his loss of property. Even if his job is considered to be a property right, the just compensation claim would not provide him the relief he wants, which is reinstatement in his job. (D) is wrong because even though there is no express provision in Article I, Section 8, concerning this legislation, it certainly is within congressional powers.\n\n",

Diana claimed that the bushes were so high that when she attempted to pull out of her own driveway, she was unable to see if traffic was approaching from the south. Diana demanded that Velma cut the bushes down to half their present height. When Velma refused, Diana, in a fit of anger, slapped Velma. Velma reached into her purse, drew out a pistol, and fired a shot at Diana but missed. Just as Velma cocked the pistol to fire another shot, Diana grabbed a shovel and hit Velma over the head, killing her instantly. Diana was charged with the murder of Velma.

Six months later, Alpha conveyed his interest in Greekacre to Gamma for $\\$ 50,000$. Alpha gave Gamma a warranty deed, which Gamma promptly recorded. As between Beta and Gamma, who has the superior right to title to Greekacre?\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Beta, regardless of the type of recording statute.\n\n(B) Gamma, regardless of the type of recording statute.\n\n(C) Beta, because she recorded prior to Gamma recording.\n\n(D) Gamma, because he took by warranty deed rather than quitclaim deed.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Because Beta recorded prior to the subsequent conveyance, Beta has the superior right to title regardless of the type of recording statute. A conveyance that is recorded can never be divested by a subsequent conveyance through operation of the recording statutes. By recording, the grantee gives constructive (or \"record\") notice to everyone. Hence, proper recording prevents anyone from becoming a subsequent BFP. Since Alpha's conveyance to Beta was recorded at the time of Alpha's conveyance to Gamma, Gamma cannot prevail. Gamma will clearly lose under a pure race statute because Beta recorded first. Gamma will also lose under notice and race-notice statutes because the conveyance to Beta was recorded at the time of the conveyance to Gamma. Gamma, therefore, had record notice and cannot claim the protection that these types of statutes provide for subsequent purchasers for value who take without notice. Thus, (A) is correct and (B) is incorrect. The fact that Beta is merely a donee rather than a bona fide purchaser does not mean that her recording has no effect. It is only the subsequent taker who has to be a BFP rather than a donee to utilize the recording statute. The prior grantee, regardless of her status, protects her interest by recording because it prevents anyone from becoming a subsequent BFP. (C) is incorrect because, as noted above, Beta will prevail under any type of recording act, but not necessarily because she recorded prior to Gamma's recording. If the jurisdiction has a notice statute, whether Beta recorded prior to Gamma's recording is irrelevant. Rather, it is the fact that Beta recorded prior to Gamma's purchase that gives Beta superior title in a notice jurisdiction, because Gamma would have record notice of the conveyance and thus would not qualify as a bona fide purchaser. (D) is incorrect because the quitclaim/warranty deed distinction does not affect who has title to Greekacre; that status merely affects the parties' respective causes of action and ability to recover against Alpha. \n\n",

Nor is it decisive that the witness testifying regarding the signature has only seen it once.

Carlos told Jones that, three months before, he had been in Karl's apartment and on that occasion had seen what appeared to be some sticks of dynamite. Reasonably believing that Carlos's information established probable cause, Jones prepared an affidavit for a search warrant. After the warrant was issued, Jones and a group of police raided Karl's apartment.

        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Denied, because Carlos was a reliable informant and Jones reasonably believed that Carlos's information was accurate and that the warrant was properly issued.\n\n(B) Granted, because in fact the police did not discover any evidence linking Karl to the bombings and, therefore, the seizure of the cocaine was fruit of the poisonous tree.\n\n(C) Granted, if the court determines that the information supplied by Carlos to Jones concerned information too remote in time to justify a claim of probable cause at the time Jones requested the search warrant.\n\n(D) Granted, because the search warrant was not issued for the purpose of searching Karl's apartment for illegal drugs.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  In order to issue a valid search warrant, the magistrate must determine that there exists reasonable grounds to believe that a legitimate item of seizure is located at the place to be searched, i.e., \"probable cause to search.\" However, a finding that the warrant was invalid because it was not supported by probable cause will not entitle a defendant to exclude the evidence obtained under the warrant if the police reasonably relied on the warrant's facial validity. Hence, (A) is correct. (B) and (D) are wrong because once the police are in the defendant's apartment with a facially valid search warrant, it is immaterial that they are unable to find the items for which the search warrant was issued, and if in their legal search they turn up other contraband, evidence of this discovery is admissible. (C) is incorrect. It is true that the length of time between the time an informant observed some facts and the time this information is given to the police is important, because the greater the time, the less chance that the facts still remain the same and, therefore, there is less probable cause to believe that the designated items are still in the place where the informant says they are.

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nThe state of Alpine has a Fair Employment Act that provides a remedy for victims of employment discrimination. The Act requires complainants to bring charges before the Alpine Fair Employment Commission within 180 days of the occurrence of alleged unlawful employment practices. The Commission then has 120 days to convene a factfinding conference to obtain evidence, ascertain the parties' positions, and explore settlement possibilities. Larson was discharged from his job with Widget Corp. purportedly because of a physical handicap unrelated to his ability to perform his job. Larson filed a timely complaint, alleging unlawful termination of employment, as required by the statute. However, through inadvertence, the Commission scheduled the factfinding conference for a date five days after expiration of the 120 -day statutory period. At the conference, Widget moved that the charge be dismissed for lack of a timely conference. The Commission denied the motion. Widget petitioned the Alpine Supreme Court. The court held for Widget, stating that the failure to comply with the 120 day requirement deprived the Commission of jurisdiction to consider Larson's charge. On appeal to the United States Supreme Court, Larson argues that his right to due process will be violated if the Commission's error is allowed to extinguish his cause of action.\n\nWhich of the following best describes the viability of Larson's due process claim?\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  The claim fails, because Larson had no protected property interest in his job.\n(B) The claim fails, because the Alpine legisla- ture, having conferred on claimants a remedy for claims of unfair employment practices, has the prerogative to establish limiting procedures for such claims.\n(C) The claim succeeds, because Larson had a protected property interest in the remedy.\n(D) The claim succeeds, because of the funda- mental unfairness of leaving Larson with- out a remedy.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Larson has more than an abstract interest in redressing his grievance. His right to redress, guaranteed by the state through its statutory enactment, is itself a property right. Although the legislature may elect not to confer a property interest, it may not constitutionally authorize the deprivation of such an interest, once conferred, without appropriate procedural safeguards. [Logan v. Zimmerman Brush (1982)] Thus, the state statute cannot be applied so as to deprive Larson of his property interest in using the statutory procedure for possible redress of unfair employment practices without at least affording him an opportunity for an appropriate hearing. It follows that (A) and (B) are incorrect, both because they state the wrong result and because they misstate the applicable rules. As indicated, Larson has a property interest and thus (A) is wrong. (B), in turn, describes a valid general rule but does not describe this case. The state can enact specific procedures, expect Larson to follow them, and bar the claim if he fails to do so. That is, however, not what happened here. Rather, the state itself failed to act in a timely manner, and the statutory time limit operated indiscriminately to extinguish Larson's claim. Finally, (D) is incorrect because it is too general. What happened to Larson was \"unfair\" because it deprived him of a property right, not because the state is required to provide any remedy, or a specific remedy.\n\n",

        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  This question involves an admission-i.e., a statement by a party (Deborah) being offered against her. An admission is not considered a hearsay statement. [Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)] Thus, (C) appears to be correct-that Walter's testimony about Deborah's statement will be admitted because it is not hearsay. (C) is not an ideal answer, though, because it is so incomplete. The fact that an item of evidence is nonhearsay does not automatically render it admissible. For example, if nonhearsay evidence is irrelevant, it would not be admissible. Thus, deciding whether (C) is the best answer requires a thorough assessment of the alternatives. (D) can be quickly discarded as incorrect. Impeachment evidence is not admissible until after the witness to be impeached has testified. It would be improper to admit Walter's testimony for the purpose of impeaching Deborah's expected testimony as to the result of her own investigation of the accident. (A) is tempting, but it is also incorrect. Normally, an out-of-court statement of a declarant, like the in-court testimony of a witness, is admissible only if it was made with personal knowledge. This requirement, however, does not apply to admissions. Thus, although Deborah's statement (\"Ned just got hurt because I forgot to do my yard work\") was made without personal knowledge, it will be admissible. As a party, Deborah will have ample opportunity to explain why she made the statement even though she lacked personal knowledge about the accident that injured Ned. The persuasiveness of her explanation will determine whether the jury takes her admission seriously. (B) is also incorrect. The common law requirement that lay witnesses were not permitted to give opinions, but only allowed to state facts, has been rejected in favor of a helpfulness standard. For example, Rule 701 allows lay witnesses to give testimony in opinion form as long as it is helpful to a clear understanding of the testimony or the determination of a fact in issue. Similarly, an admission is not rendered inadmissible merely because it is in opinion form. For example, a party's statement that \"I was negligent\"' or \"It was all my fault\" will be admitted into evidence as an admission. Therefore, although (C) is not an ideal answer, it is basically correct, and (A), (B), and (D) are clearly incorrect.\n\n",

Common law murder does include the situation where the actor, with the intent to cause serious bodily harm, causes the death of another person, but that would be second degree murder under the State Red statute. (B) would not be first degree murder. Here again there was no premeditated and deliberate killing and DWI is not one of the crimes listed. Common law murder does include the fact situation where the actor causes death under circumstances demonstrating an extreme indifference to the value of human life, but that would be second degree murder under the statute. (D) would not be first degree murder. Killings that take place during the heat of passion after sufficient provocation are manslaughter at common law and would not be considered a premeditated and deliberate killing under the statute. Being assaulted by another would be sufficient provocation. (C) would probably be considered first degree murder. There was premeditation and deliberation. Finding one's spouse in a sex act with another is considered sufficient provocation and, if the killing had occurred immediately (no cooling off period) while the defendant was in a rage, the crime would have been manslaughter. In (C), however, the killing did not take place immediately-the defendant purchased a gun.

        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "(A)  This question raises several different issues: competency of witnesses, use of leading questions on cross-examination, the proper scope of cross-examination, and the probative value/prejudicial impact balancing test. Through a process of elimination, (B) emerges as the correct answer. (D) is incorrect. Under the Federal Rules, virtually all witnesses with personal knowledge are competent to testify. [Fed. R. Evid. 601] A witness is not rendered incompetent simply by having served on a jury in a prior case involving a party to the current suit. Such prior jury service might render the witness's testimony unpersuasive, but it would not make it inadmissible. (C) is incorrect because ordinarily, leading questions are permitted on cross-examination. [Fed. R. Evid. 611(c)] The prosecutor's question is a leading question, but that is perfectly permissible, especially in a case like this, where the alibi witness, Warren, is not \"friendly\" toward the prosecution. (A) is incorrect because cross-examination is generally limited in scope to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness [Fed. $R$. Evid. 611(b)], and the prosecutor's question is, in a roundabout way, an attempt to impeach Warren's credibility. The implication behind the question is that if Warren had served on a jury that acquitted Drew of another criminal charge, Warren would be inclined to think Drew innocent of the pending charge. Alternatively, the implication behind the question could be that Warren is the kind of person who is \"soft on crime\" and for that reason is not a credible witness. In either event, since the question is an attempt to impeach Warren's testimony, it is within the proper scope of cross-examination. This leaves (B) as the remaining correct answer. (B) is not unquestionably correct, because the probative value/prejudicial impact balancing test found in Rule 403 is weighted heavily toward admission of evidence. For evidence to be excluded under this balancing test, its probative value must be substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact. Nevertheless, in this case, a plausible reason for sustaining an objection to the prosecutor's question is that the probative value of the answer would be substantially outweighed by its tendency to mislead. The question and answer would inevitably let the jury know that Drew had been previously charged with a crime. This information could be highly prejudicial to his defense. Since the question and answer have little probative value (the negative inferences pertaining to Warren's credibility being very weak), it is reasonable to sustain an objection to the question on the basis that its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact.\n\n",

        "Explanation": "(A)  In a race-notice jurisdiction such as West Dakota, a subsequent purchaser must have taken without notice of the earlier sale and must have been the first to record.

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nCapitol City, West Carolina, has a city ordinance that prohibits the distribution of pamphlets \"on public sidewalks or other public areas when foot traffic is sufficiently heavy and the manner of distribution of the pamphlets causes obstruction of the foot traffic so as to result in spillover onto public streets where vehicular traffic creates a danger to human life.\"' The West Carolina state fair is held at fairgrounds whose entrances lie along a busy multilane street. Roger, who was distributing pamphlets advocating repeal of the federal milk price support program during Dairy Day at the state fair, attracted a crowd of about 10 farmers and children outside the fairgrounds entrance at which he stood, but most of the few fairgoers entering the fair at that late afternoon time simply ignored him. When one of the dairy farmers became irate and threatened to \"knock his block off,\" Roger was arrested by a fair security guard and subsequently prosecuted under the city ordinance.\n\nWhich of the following statements is correct regarding the city ordinance and Roger's prosecution?\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  The ordinance is void on its face and void as applied to Roger.\n(B) The ordinance is valid on its face but void as applied to Roger.\n(C) The ordinance is valid on its face and valid as applied to Roger. \n\n",
        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Substantially overbroad or vague statutes regulating First Amendment rights are void on their face, and persons may not be prosecuted for their violation even if their conduct might otherwise be subject to valid regulation. Conversely, statutes that reasonably regulate the time, place, and manner of speech in public forums may be unconstitutional if applied in situations where the First Amendment activity is unreasonably infringed. Here, the statute is a valid time, place, and manner restriction because it is content neutral, it is narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and it leaves open alternative channels of communication. However, it is being applied to circumstances that do not provide any reasonable basis for regulation of the speech. Thus, (B) is correct: while Roger's conduct can be regulated, it is the threat by the farmer that triggers Roger's arrest, not his violation of the statute. (A) and (D) are incorrect since the statute itself is valid on its face. (C) is incorrect, in turn, because it wrongly asserts that Roger may be prosecuted under these circumstances. \n\n",

Evidence of other crimes is admissible against an accused in a criminal case if it is relevant to some issue other than the defendant's character or disposition to commit the crime charged.

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nCyrus and Myrtle are adjoining landowners. On Myrtle's property there is a natural freshwater spring. Cyrus asked Myrtle if it would be possible to build an irrigation ditch from the spring to his property in order to provide water for his cattle. Since the spring supplied more than enough water to meet Myrtle's needs, she agreed, provided that Cyrus construct the ditch in such a manner that it would need the least maintenance possible, because Myrtle did not wish to be continually bothered by Cyrus's coming on her land. Cyrus constructed a concrete irrigation ditch from the spring to the land. The cost of construction of the ditch was $\\$ 25,000$. The only maintenance required on the ditch was a semiannual cleaning. Three years later, Myrtle informed Cyrus that her water needs had increased and that she could no longer allow Cyrus to take water from the spring. In addition, Myrtle did not allow Cyrus on her land to do the semiannual cleaning, resulting in the blocking of the ditch.\n\nCyrus wishes to keep water flowing through the irrigation ditch to his land. Which of the following would be his strongest argument? ",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Cyrus owns a valid easement appurtenant to Myrtle's property.\n\n(B) Because Myrtle has allowed Cyrus to construct the irrigation ditch, Myrtle would be estopped from preventing Cyrus from coming onto her land.\n\n(C) Cyrus, although a licensee, has expended such a substantial sum of money in constructing the irrigation ditch that Myrtle may not terminate Cyrus's license now.\n\n(D) Cyrus, although a licensee, may continue to enter Myrtle's property to clean and maintain the ditch until he is able to acquire another source of water.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  The original grant by Myrtle to Cyrus was a license, which is a personal privilege to go upon the land belonging to the licensor. When Cyrus expended a substantial sum of money in reliance on the license, the license became irrevocable under the doctrine of estoppel. (A) is wrong because Myrtle was estopped from terminating the license, not just from preventing Cyrus from coming onto her land. (D) is wrong because the duration of the irrevocable license is based on what the parties contemplated would be the duration when the oral license was granted and the facts do not indicate that they intended it to exist until Cyrus acquired another source of water. (B) is wrong because the estoppel is based not on the mere construction of the ditch but the expenditure of a substantial sum of money in reliance on the license.

He went to Alice's computer resale shop to find a replacement and saw what he mistakenly thought was his computer. He questioned Alice, who told him that someone had just sold her the computer a few days ago, but she refused to give him any information on the seller and would not let him inspect it more closely. That night, after the shop was closed, Delbert forced open the back door and took the computer. Alice's clerk, who lived in an apartment above the shop, heard someone breaking in and called the police. Delbert was apprehended a block away from the building.\n\nIf Delbert is charged with burglary in a jurisdiction retaining the common law criminal offenses, which of the following facts will be most relevant in determining his guilt or innocence?\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  His mistake as to the identity of the com- puter was not reasonable.\n(B) He was unaware that there was an apart- ment above the shop and did not believe that anyone lived in the building.\n(C) He realized that the computer was not his before he carried it out.\n(D) None of the above facts are relevant. \n\n",
        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "(A)  It will be most relevant to determining Delbert's guilt or innocent if he was unaware that the building he broke into was a dwelling. An element of the crime of common law burglary is that the breaking and entering be of the dwelling of another; hence, awareness of the building's use as a dwelling is a component of the mens rea for the crime. Delbert's ignorance or mistake regarding the building's use as a dwelling may negate the mens rea for that element of the crime of burglary. (A) is incorrect because it is not necessary that Delbert's mistake as to the identity of the computer be reasonable. Ignorance or mistake as to a matter of fact will affect guilt only if it shows that the defendant did not have the state of mind required for the crime. While courts have required that a mistake offered to negate the existence of a general intent be reasonable, any mistake of fact, reasonable or unreasonable, is a defense to a specific intent crime. Here, burglary requires the specific intent to commit a felony inside the dwelling at the time of entry. Delbert may not have had the intent to commit a felony if he believed that he was just retrieving his own computer that had been stolen. If so, the fact that his belief was unreasonable is irrelevant; it still negates the specific intent to commit a felony. (C) is incorrect because his realization that the computer was not his after he had broken into the shop is not relevant for purposes of burglary (although he may have committed larceny under those circumstances). The intent to commit a felony must have existed at the time of entry. If the intent is formed after the entry is completed, burglary is not committed. (D) is wrong because, as discussed above, Delbert's ignorance of the building's status as a dwelling may be a defense.\n\n",

        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  The gift in trust to Rockville University is a valid charitable trust. To be valid, a charitable trust must have an indefinite group of beneficiaries. The beneficiaries must be reasonably numerous and not individually identified. The trust may be for the benefit of an established charity or for a group of persons, as long as it is for a charitable purpose. Here, a trust for the benefit of a university to pay for the educational expenses of residents of a city qualifies as a charitable trust. Thus, (A) is correct and (C) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because the doctrine of cy pres applies only when the purposes of a charitable trust are impossible to fulfill, are illegal, or have been completely fulfilled, allowing a court to redirect the trust to a different purpose that is as near as may be to the settlor's original intent. Here, because the trust purposes can be fulfilled, the doctrine does not apply. (D) is incorrect because the gift to Rockville University is certain to vest within the perpetuities period. The Rule Against Perpetuities applies to the equitable future interests of the beneficiaries in a private trust just as it does to legal future interests. Seth's three children are lives in being at the time the trust becomes effective, which is Seth's death.

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nHarriet observed an automobile accident that took place across the street from her house. She noticed at the time that the green car, which was driven by Def, did not come to a complete stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection to strike the yellow car driven by Plee after Plee's car had already entered the intersection. Plee sued Def for damages and injuries, but the trial did not take place until almost three years after the accident. Plee wanted Harriet to testify on his behalf against Def, but Harriet's recollection of the accident was very fuzzy. The night before she was scheduled to testify, Harriet consulted her diary, in which Harriet had noted that Def's car ran the stop sign and entered the intersection after Plee's car was already in the intersection. Plee's attorney called Harriet to the stand, and she testified regarding Def's failure to observe the stop sign and Def's entrance into the intersection after Plee.\n\nOn cross-examination, Def's attorney asked Harriet if she had consulted any materials to prepare for her testimony. Harriet admitted that her recollection of the accident had been fuzzy and that she had consulted her diary the night before her testimony. Def's attorney immediately moved that Harriet's testimony be stricken from the record.\n\nThe court should rule that:\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Harriet's testimony is admissible if, after reviewing her notes, she had an independent recollection of the event.\n\n(B) Harriet's testimony is admissible, because the contents of her diary are protected under the work product rule.\n\n(C) Harriet's testimony should be stricken, because her diary was not made available to the opposing party prior to trial.\n\n(D) Harriet's testimony should be stricken, because it is not the best evidence.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  This question involves testimony by a witness, Harriet, whose recollection has been refreshed by reference to a document (her diary). Under the Federal Rules, any materials can be used to refresh one's recollection, and the Rules do not prohibit the use of such materials before trial. Thus, (A) is correct. (B) can quickly be discarded as incorrect. The contents of Harriet's diary are not remotely protected under the work product rule. The work product rule involves a product, such as a document, prepared in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial, by or on behalf of a party. Harriet is not a party, and her diary was not prepared in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial. It is, presumably, merely a collection of private thoughts transcribed for Harriet's personal edification. (D) is also incorrect. The best evidence rule does not literally require a party to produce the best evidence possible to prove a point. Rather, it requires the production of the original document when attempting to prove the contents of a document. [Fed. R. Evid. 1002] Although Harriet used a document to refresh her recollection and enable her to testify, her testimony concerned the details of an auto accident, not the contents of the document. Since Harriet was testifying about an event, as opposed to the contents of her diary, her testimony was proper, notwithstanding the failure to produce the diary. (C) is a tempting answer, but ultimately incorrect. If a witness's recollection has been refreshed prior to trial by reference to a document, the court has discretion to require that the document be disclosed to the opposing party. [Fed. R. Evid. 612] The court is not required to order disclosure. In this case, there is no indication that the court ordered disclosure of the diary or that Plee failed to comply with an order to produce the diary. All that is known is that, upon learning through cross-examination of Harriet that she had consulted her diary the night before, Def's attorney immediately moved that Harriet's testimony be stricken from the record. Since there is nothing improper about a witness's refreshing her recollection prior to trial, Def's motion should be denied and Harriet's testimony should remain on the record.\n\n",

Defendant later sells the set at a flea market. \n\n",
        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Burglary requires a breaking and entry of a dwelling of another at nighttime with the intent to commit a felony therein.

In (A), the defendant would not be guilty of burglary. There is no indication of a breaking and entering, the office would probably not be a dwelling, and, most important, defendant's belief that he owned the briefcase would negate the intent to commit a larceny or other felony. In (C), the defendant would probably not be guilty of burglary. At common law, an honest belief that you were entitled to take the property of another as repayment for a debt negated the intent necessary for larceny.

In 2000 , one of School's former students informed the principal of School that a geological survey of the area had indicated that there were valuable minerals beneath the surface of Goldacre. School, badly in need of money, granted to Mine Co. a right to remove the minerals from a one-acre portion of Goldacre upon the payment of a percentage of the value of the minerals removed. From 2000 to 2004, Mine Co. conducted mining operations on the one-acre portion of Goldacre. School had continued to conduct classes in the temporary building located on Goldacre. In 2004, while Owens and Wilma were still alive, both of Owens's children filed suit against School and Mine Co. seeking damages for the removal of minerals since 2000 , an injunction preventing further acts of removal, and all other appropriate remedies.\n\nWhich of the following would be the most likely result?\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  School and Mine Co. should be enjoined, and damages should be recovered, but impounded for future distribution.\n\n(B) The children should succeed, because the interest of School terminated with the first removal of minerals from Goldacre. (C) The injunction should be granted, but damages should be denied because Owens and Wilma are not parties to the action.\n\n(D) Damages should be awarded, but the injunction should be denied.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Both damages and an injunction would be in order. School has a life estate pur autre vie while Owens's children have a vested remainder subject to open. Absent an \"open mine\" in existence at the creation of the life estate and remainder, a life tenant cannot extract minerals from the land because it depletes the corpus and constitutes waste. Thus, the remainderman could recover damages and obtain an injunction for the unlawful waste. (B) is wrong since School's action did not terminate its interest. School's interest is not a defeasible one at all since the language that purports to restrict its use to educational purposes is only precatory and provides for no termination or forfeiture if School fails to comply. (C) is wrong because it is entirely unnecessary for Owens and Wilma to be parties since neither of them has any interest in the land.

Though there is not a great deal of bite left in the Tenth Amendment under current case law, particularly with regard to congressional conditions on expenditures of federal money, this is still the best argument presented. (B) is not the best answer because it goes too far; the doctrine of federalism relates to the functions of state government, not to all the actions of the state government. Clearly, the federal government could prevent the state from exercising its power in such a manner as to deprive its citizens of their federal rights, including those rights with regard to public education. (A) is obviously wrong, because the doctrine of federal preemption prevents the states from interfering with the effect and purposes of federal law. (D) is wrong because it is too narrow.

The law was immediately challenged in federal court by an interstate trucking firm which regularly transported prohibited nuclear materials through West Rabbit's Foot on the highway. The case ultimately reached the United States Supreme Court, which held in a 5-4 decision that the challenged ordinance was constitutional because the city had a rational basis for concluding that the citizens of West Rabbit's Foot would be safer if the prohibited materials were kept outside of town, and because the ordinance did not unduly burden interstate commerce. Many other towns and cities throughout the nation considered similar enactments after the Supreme Court decision was announced.

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nShelley lived in a house on a large corner lot. A few hundred feet down the street was a convenience store used by many people in the neighborhood, and everyone would take a short cut across Shelley's front yard rather than staying on the sidewalk that bordered her lawn. \n\n\\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}\n\nThe heavy foot traffic was starting to wear a path through her lawn, and everyone left soft drink cans and candy wrappers strewn all over her front yard. Shelley therefore decided to build a fence around her front lawn, and hired Jack, a local contractor, to do the work. The next afternoon, Jack started the job by surveying the property and digging post holes. After he had completed that task, he left to do another small job in that area, leaving behind a wheelbarrow with a shovel leaning against it. When Shelley noticed that Jack had left the wheelbarrow and shovel in her front yard, she called his office and spoke to his wife. Jack's wife said that he was on another job in the area and must have intended to pick up the wheelbarrow and shovel on his way back. Shelley said that was fine, and left to go to her weekly bridge club meeting. Later that evening, Jack, who had finished the other job, returned to his office without stopping at Shelley's house.\n\nEric, who owned a house down the street from Shelley, was walking to the convenience store to pick up a six-pack of beer. Because it was summer, it was still quite light, although it was 7 p.m. When he came to Shelley's house he took his usual short cut. A police car with siren wailing went by on the main street just as Eric was walking by the wheelbarrow, and as he followed the police car with his eyes, he tripped over the shovel leaning against the wheelbarrow and fell, breaking his arm.\n\nIs Shelley liable to Eric for his broken arm and related damages?\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  No, because she did not create the condition that harmed him.\n\n(B) No, because the danger to which he was exposed was open and obvious.\n\n(C) Yes, because she was aware of the condition that harmed him.\n\n(D) Yes, because she knew that he frequently cut across her lawn on the way to the convenience store.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Eric cannot recover because the cause of his injury was not a highly dangerous concealed artificial condition. Generally, the owner or occupier of land does not owe a duty to an ordinary trespasser to warn of dangerous conditions on the land or to make the land safe. Where the trespasser is an anticipated trespasser-i.e., where the landowner knows that people habitually intrude upon a particular part of her land-a duty to warn of or make safe highly dangerous concealed artificial conditions known to the landowner arises. However, there is no duty to warn of conditions so apparent that the trespasser should be able to discover them himself. Here, even though Eric qualifies as an anticipated trespasser, the wheelbarrow and shovel were neither concealed nor highly dangerous. Thus, (B) is correct. (A) is incorrect because it would be irrelevant whether the landowner created the artificial condition if she were otherwise liable because she allowed the condition to remain on her land. (C) is incorrect because mere knowledge of the dangerous condition does not impose a duty to warn. (D) is incorrect because, as stated above, Shelley had no duty to warn of obvious artificial conditions.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nFred, a licensed real estate broker, and Tom, a homeowner, entered into a written listing agreement in which, among other things, Tom promised to pay Fred a commission of $6 \\%$ of the selling price of Tom's home if Fred obtained a buyer ready, willing, and able to purchase it. Tom's home was listed in a service made available to real estate professionals, with an asking price of $\\$ 80,000$.\n\nMurray, looking for a home to buy, went to Fred's real estate office and was shown Tom's home. He submitted a written offer to purchase the home for $\\$ 80,000$, but Tom rejected this offer by, according to its terms, not accepting it within a stated period. Tom did not want to sell to Murray because, given the amount Murray had intended to borrow, Tom would have had to take back a second mortgage for a portion of his equity, and he did not consider Murray a good credit risk.\n\nMurray brings an action against Tom for specific performance, seeking to compel him to sell the home. What is the probable outcome of this litigation?\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Tom will win, because no writing or writings constitute a memorandum sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.\n\n(B) Tom will win, because Murray's remedy at law is adequate.\n\n(C) Murray will win, because he is a thirdparty beneficiary of the agreement between Tom and Fred.\n\n(D) Murray will win, because there is a memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Murray cannot obtain specific performance against Tom because the absence of a written memorandum signed by Tom and containing the essential terms of an agreement between Murray and Tom means that there is no enforceable contract. To obtain specific performance, there must be an enforceable contract between the parties. Pursuant to the Statute of Frauds, a contract for the sale of land is not enforceable unless it is evidenced by a writing signed by the party sought to be bound. In addition to this signature, the writing should contain a recital of consideration, the terms and conditions of the agreement, the identity of the party sought to be charged, and an identification of the contractual subject matter. Murray is attempting to obtain specific performance of a contract to purchase Tom's house. Thus, Murray must show the existence of a contract through a writing sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. The only writings mentioned in the facts are Murray's written offer to purchase the house and the real estate listing agreement between Tom and Fred. The latter reflects only an agreement between Tom and Fred as to the terms of Fred's services as a broker in connection with the sale of Tom's house. This in no way constitutes written evidence of an agreement between Tom and Murray. Murray's written offer was never signed by Tom and was, in fact, rejected by Tom in a manner consistent with its terms. Thus, this writing does not memorialize an agreement between Tom and Murray for the sale of Tom's house; no agreement was ever reached. Therefore, there is no enforceable contract that can be the subject of specific performance. (D) is incorrect because, as explained above, there is no memorandum signed by Tom that lists the essential terms of an agreement between Tom and Murray. In fact, there was never any such agreement, much less a writing reflecting its terms. (B) is incorrect because a purchaser of land is almost always deemed to have an inadequate remedy at law. Each parcel of land is always considered unique; i.e., unlike any other that could be purchased with the same sum of money. Thus, if Murray did have a cause of action against Tom, he would not have an adequate remedy at law. (C) is incorrect because the facts do not indicate that Fred and Tom intended that Murray or any other third person benefit by their agreement. Application of the factors that courts use to determine whether a third party is an intended beneficiary who can enforce a contract between the contracting parties or an incidental beneficiary who has no rights under the contract indicates that Murray is not an intended beneficiary. The agreement did not: (i) expressly designate a third party; (ii) indicate that performance was to be made directly to a third party; or (iii) state that a third party had any rights under the contract. Also, there is no relationship between Murray and either Tom or Fred from which it could be inferred that either Tom or Fred wished to make the agreement for Murray's benefit. Thus, Murray is not an intended beneficiary of the agreement between Tom and Fred and cannot recover on that agreement.\n\n",

Evan, a physics teacher at the local college, was also a model rocket enthusiast. On many occasions he would launch one of his rockets from the back area of his property, and although none of Evan's rockets ever came near Kenton's property, Kenton was understandably upset. Kenton complained to Evan several times about his hobby and the fact that Evan stored flammable fuels in his house. Once, Kenton complained to the county sheriff, whereupon Evan was charged with violating a local ordinance that prohibits the improper storage of flammable liquids on residential property. He was given a warning and told that he must have proper storage permits and facilities if he intended to keep the fuels for his model rockets on his property. Although Evan obtained the proper permits to build underground storage tanks for his fuels, he continued to store them in 55gallon drums in a shed located on the edge of his property farthest away from Kenton.\n\nEventually, Kenton brought a suit based on public nuisance against Evan. If Kenton is seeking an injunction against Evan to prevent his storing flammable liquids on his property and his launching model rockets, the defense by which Evan most likely would prevail is that:\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  He obtained a permit from the city to build storage tanks for the fuels.\n(B) There is no showing that Kenton suffered any special damage.\n(C) This is not a residential neighborhood.\n(D) There is no specific ordinance that prohib- its Evan from launching model rockets on his own property.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "(A)  A public nuisance exists when a property owner is using his property in such a manner that it creates an unreasonable risk to the public in general. The owner need not be violating a specific statute in order to be a public nuisance; hence, (D) is incorrect. Nor is it determinative that the owner has a permit to engage in the activity if the owner's use otherwise constitutes a public nuisance. (Albeit, in many cases it would be hard to show a public nuisance if the owner did have a permit to use his property in a certain manner. But the facts of this case show that Evan had not complied with the provisions of the permit.) Evan would be correct in arguing that it is not a nuisance per se in storing the flammable liquids on his property since this is not a residential neighborhood; however, (C) is not the best answer because it still could be shown that under this particular situation it was a nuisance. Nevertheless, it is generally the duty of the local district attorney to bring actions to enjoin public nuisances, and private citizens will generally have no standing to bring such suit unless the private citizen can show that he suffers some special injury in addition to that sustained by the general public. The facts in this case fail to show such special injury, so (B) would be Evan's best defense.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nHarry and Wilma were going through a divorce proceeding and were contesting the value of their house. Harry, a real estate agent familiar with property values in the area, had personally prepared an appraisal shortly before commencement of the divorce proceedings. The appraisal document stated that the house was worth $\\$ 200,000$. Nora, a next-door neighbor of Harry and Wilma's, had seen this appraisal document. During settlement negotiations, Harry maintained that the house was worth $\\$ 180,000$. When negotiations proved to be fruitless, the parties proceeded to trial. At trial, Wilma called Nora to testify as to the value placed on the house in the appraisal document. Nora's only knowledge as to the house's value comes from having read the document. Harry's attorney objects.\n\nMay Nora testify as to the value stated in the appraisal document?\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Yes, because she has personal knowledge of the contents of the document.\n\n(B) Yes, if Harry has destroyed the document.\n\n(C) No, because the appraisal document is the best, and thus the only admissible, evidence.\n\n(D) No, because Nora's testimony would be inadmissible hearsay.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Under the best evidence rule, in proving the terms of a writing, where the terms are material, the original writing must be produced. Secondary evidence of the writing, such as oral testimony regarding the writing's contents, is permitted only after it has been shown that the original is unavailable for some reason other than serious misconduct of the proponent. Here, the value of the house is of major importance, and the contents of the document are closely related to this central issue. Consequently, Nora, whose only knowledge of this significant litigated issue comes from having read the document, is precluded from testifying as to the contents of the document unless the unavailability of the writing is established. Destruction of the original without fault of the party offering the secondary evidence constitutes a satisfactory explanation for nonproduction of the original and justifies the admissibility of secondary evidence. Thus, (B) is a better answer than (C). (A) is incorrect because personal knowledge of the contents does not in and of itself justify admissibility of the testimony. (D) is incorrect because the appraisal document, personally prepared by Harry, constitutes an admission by a party-opponent; i.e., a prior acknowledgment by a party of one of the relevant facts. Under the Federal Rules, such statements are nonhearsay.\n\n",

[Immigration \\& Naturalization Service v.

        "Answer Choices": "(A)  The commerce power.\n(B) The Necessary and Proper Clause.\n(C) The police power.\n(D) The power to regulate federal lands.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Congress has the power, under the Commerce Clause, to regulate any activity that, taken cumulatively, has substantial economic or commercial effect on interstate commerce. Although there are limits on the power of Congress to regulate commerce, in only a few cases has the Court invalidated a federal law as exceeding the scope of Congress's commerce power. Since Congress has concluded that the animal is important to the region's tourism industry, and given the comparative weakness of the other answers, (A) is the strongest argument. (B) is incorrect because the Necessary and Proper Clause must be linked with another constitutional power of Congress. Here it is presented by itself, not in connection with another power, and thus it is incorrect. (C) is incorrect because there is no federal police power. (D) is wrong. The facts of this question do not offer any facts suggesting that the animals are on federal lands. Thus, the power to regulate federal lands is irrelevant.\n\n",

When Manfred's neighbors began complaining about his yard, Manfred decided that he would simply take his dream mower. Gardenshop had so many, they would never miss it, he reasoned.

Prior to purchase, Developer had shown Andrew the wooden stakes, and Andrew accepted such stakes as marking the boundaries of Lot 20 . After taking possession of Lot 20 , Andrew built a house thereon and enclosed it with a fence.\n\nOn September 5, Bruce purchased Lot 21 from Developer. Lot 21 was adjacent to Lot 20. After taking possession of Lot 21, Bruce hired a licensed surveyor to survey Lot 21 . This surveyor discovered that, according to the recorded plat, Andrew's fence extended two feet onto Lot 21. Upon learning this, Bruce demanded that Andrew remove his fence. Andrew refused.\n\nIf Bruce sues Andrew, who will prevail?\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Andrew, because he bought his lot first.\n(B) Andrew, because the surveyor's stakes are controlling.\n(C) Bruce, because the recorded plat controls.\n(D) Bruce, because the adverse possession period has not run.\n\n",

        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Battery is a general intent crime that can be established with a mental state of recklessness. In addition, all crimes require a voluntary act on the part of the actor. The epileptic seizure would negate both the voluntary act and the culpable mental state. In (A), the defendant would probably be guilty of battery. Intoxication is not a defense to a general intent crime, and the defendant's behavior would probably be classified as reckless. In (B), the defendant might be found guilty of battery.

It so happened, however, that Truman had used the 15 acres taken by the government to store vehicles necessary in Truman's work. Truman knew of no other place nearby where he could store the vehicles.

        "Explanation": "(A)  The only value his tickets will have to anyone is if they are used for admission to the All-Star game.

(A) is not a correct answer because, although the intent to return the tickets may be a valid defense in some situations, in this situation Tom would have been permanently deprived of their value when they were returned, and therefore Dennis's intention would not be a valid defense. (B) is a tempting answer, but it is not the most likely. There are no facts that indicate the relative value of the tickets to the money that Dennis claims Tom owes him.

On September 14, Vinnie purchased an additional 150 tons of premium quality pinot chardonnay grapes from Godfrey, one of several other available sources for premium quality pinot chardonnay grapes.

Dieter, a mentally disabled 11-year-old child, had been abandoned by his parents and lived in the Miserere Home, a State B residential facility for the developmentally disabled operated by the Sisters of Hope, a religious order. Sister Mary Smith was the director of the facility. The Miserere Home had no fence around it, because children who lived there were not considered to be dangerous. Dieter wandered away from the premises and was gone for 36 hours before he was found by the police and returned to Miserere. When Dieter was away from the facility, he beat up Paul, a five-year-old boy. Paul's parents filed suit against Sister Mary on Paul's behalf.\n\nAssuming that no other liability statute applies, who will prevail? ",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Paul, because under the statute Sister Mary has the responsibilities and duties of a parent.\n\n(B) Paul, because Sister Mary is strictly liable for Dieter's acts.\n\n(C) Sister Mary, because parents are not vicariously liable for the intentional torts of their children.\n\n(D) Sister Mary, unless she knew that Dieter had dangerous propensities.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Parents are not vicariously liable at common law for the intentional torts of their children (although many states have imposed limited liability for certain conduct by statute). However, a parent (or anyone else having care or custody of a child) can be held liable for injuries caused by the child where the parent herself was negligent. For example, the parent may be liable for failing to exercise reasonable care to protect against the child's known dangerous tendencies. Here, pursuant to statute, Sister Mary stood in loco parentis to Dieter. Thus, Sister Mary could be held liable if she knew that Dieter had dangerous propensities, and failed to take appropriate measures (e.g., keeping a closer watch on Dieter). Sister Mary then would be liable for her own negligence, not vicariously liable for Dieter's intentional tort. (D) is the only alternative that mentions the important factor of Sister Mary's knowledge regarding Dieter's dangerous propensities. (A) is incorrect because it ignores the fact that Sister Mary's liability depends upon her knowledge of any dangerous propensities on the part of Dieter. (B) is incorrect because neither raising children generally nor operating a home for developmentally disabled children are abnormally dangerous activities giving rise to strict liability.

        "Explanation": "(A)  Clearly this statute burdens interstate commerce by diverting purchases which would otherwise be made from interstate businesses to intrastate suppliers and by imposing a tax on interstate suppliers. Both requirements have the purpose and effect of imposing a direct burden on interstate commerce and, especially in the case of the tax, do so in a facially discriminatory manner. As such, they would be subjected to strict scrutiny, and would fail. (D) is therefore the best answer.

(B) is wrong because there is a rational basis for the classification and no suspect classification or fundamental right is involved.

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nPaul sues Daniel for personal injuries that Paul suffered as a result of a battery committed on Paul by Daniel. Daniel's defense is that it is all a case of mistaken identity. Daniel admits that Paul was beaten up, but claims he had nothing to do with Paul's injuries. At trial, Daniel testified in his own behalf that on the date that Paul suffered his injuries, Daniel was on an extended vacation in England, 2,000 miles away from the place where the battery occurred. Paul's attorney did not cross-examine Daniel regarding that testimony. In rebuttal, Paul's attorney calls Walter, who is willing to testify that one week after Paul suffered his injuries, Daniel said to Walter, \"I haven't been out of the country in five years.\"\n\nWalter's testimony is:\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Admissible as a statement against interest by Daniel.\n\n(B) Admissible as a prior inconsistent statement of Daniel.\n\n(C) Admissible as an admission by Daniel.\n\n(D) Inadmissible, because Daniel was not given an opportunity to comment on the statement prior to Walter's testimony.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Daniel's statement is an admission-an out-of-court statement by a party being offered into evidence by an opposing party. [Fed. R. Evid. $801(\\mathrm{~d})(2)$ ] Since it is not considered hearsay evidence and is obviously relevant to the underlying question of who committed the battery against Paul, it would be admissible. (A) is incorrect because the \"statement against interest\" exception to the hearsay rule provides that a declarant's out-of-court statement is admissible if it is against the declarant's interest when made. [Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3)] Daniel's out-of-court statement (\"I haven't been out of the country in five years\") was not clearly against his interest when it was made. It is vastly different, for example, than if Daniel had confided to Walter that he had beaten Paul; that would be a statement against interest at the time the statement was made. That Daniel's actual statement to Walter was ultimately used against Daniel does not qualify it as a statement against interest. Also, and equally important, (A) is incorrect because the \"statement against interest\" exception to the hearsay rule comes into play only if the declarant is unavailable to testify (e.g., because the declarant is dead or cannot be found). [Fed. R. Evid. 804(a)] The question makes clear that Daniel not only is available to testify, but he actually does testify. Hence, the \"unavailability\" requirement of the \"statement against interest\" exception has not been satisfied. (B) is a plausible answer, but not as good as (C) because it contains several ambiguities. The answer is ambiguous as to the purpose for which Daniel's prior inconsistent statement is offered into evidence. If offered for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted in the statement, it would be inadmissible hearsay evidence; it would not meet the specific requirements of Rule $801(\\mathrm{~d})(1)(\\mathrm{A})$ to qualify as nonhearsay evidence: Daniel's prior inconsistent statement was not made under oath at another proceeding. If offered for the purpose of impeaching Daniel's testimony, however, the prior inconsistent statement might be admissible. Proving the prior inconsistent statement of a witness is a well-accepted method for impeaching the testimony of that witness. In this case, though, extrinsic evidence (the testimony of another witness, Walter) is being offered to prove Daniel's prior inconsistent statement. Extrinsic evidence can be used to show a prior inconsistent statement of a witness, for purposes of impeachment, only if the inconsistency goes to a material issue in the case. It would, at best, be a judgment call as to whether Daniel's not having left the country in five years is a material issue in Paul's suit against Daniel for battery. Thus, (C) is a better answer than (B). (D) is incorrect because, since Daniel's statement is an admission, its admissibility is not dependent on Daniel's having the opportunity to comment on it. Moreover, even if Daniel's statement were analyzed solely from the standpoint of being a prior inconsistent statement offered to impeach, (D) would be incorrect. The Federal Rules have abolished the common law requirement that a witness be given an opportunity to explain a prior inconsistent statement before extrinsic evidence of the statement can be admitted; the opportunity may be provided after introduction of the statement.\n\n",

(B) is not the most likely answer either, because there is no showing that Defendant intended to kill anyone, or that when he fired the pistol it was likely that he would kill anyone.

Abstract injury is not enough; the plaintiff must show that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of the challenged official conduct.

The mist drifts over Clampett's property which is adjacent to Growit's plant. Although Growit uses the best technology available, it is unable to prevent the release of the mist.

        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Valid, because the interest vests, if at all, within a life in being.\n\n(B) Valid, because it grants Oliver Jr. a reversionary interest.\n\n(C) Invalid, because the will grants Melinda the complete interest in the property, so there is nothing to be left to Oliver Jr.\n\n(D) Invalid, if this jurisdiction does not recognize a testator's ability to convey a possibility of reverter by will.\n\n\n\n",

The judge instructed the jury that the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Dennis was guilty of larceny and that the evidence tended to show that Dennis had taken some jewels belonging to the victim; but if they believed that Dennis had proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he did not intend to keep the jewels, but to return them, they should find him not guilty. Dennis was convicted of larceny. He appeals the conviction, contending that the judge erred in his instructions to the jury.\n\nDennis's conviction will probably be:\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Affirmed, because the jury has the power to ignore Dennis's testimony if they do not believe him.\n\n(B) Affirmed, because Dennis had failed to rebut the State's evidence tending to show that he intended to keep the jewels.\n\n(C) Reversed, because the judge cannot comment at all on the evidence.\n\n(D) Reversed, because the instructions put some of the burden of proof on Dennis.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "(A)  The prosecutor is required by the Due Process Clause to prove each and every element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. One of the elements of larceny is an intent to permanently deprive a victim of his or her property, and the instructions in this case put the burden of proof on Dennis to show that there was no such intent. This relieves the prosecution of its burden because it implies that there is a presumption that Dennis intended to permanently deprive her of her jewels. (A) is wrong. The jury does have the power to ignore Dennis's testimony, but the conviction will be reversed because of the unconstitutional instruction on burden of proof. (B) is wrong. Dennis is not required to rebut the state's evidence; the state must prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt. (C) is not the best answer. While it is true that in some jurisdictions the judge cannot comment on the evidence in a criminal case, that prohibition would not be violated by an appropriate instruction on burden of proof.\n\n",

At the time of the accident, Wilber, the driver of the truck, said to Sam, \"The accident was my fault; I wasn't paying any attention. Don't worry, my company will make it right.\"' The subsequent investigation of the accident by Ace revealed that Wilber had been drinking on the day of the accident. Wilber was fired.\n\nSam brings an appropriate action against Ace for damages resulting from the accident. Wilber has disappeared. Sam seeks to testify as to what Wilber said at the time of the accident.\n\nThe evidence is:\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Admissible, as an admission by an employ- ee of the defendant.\n(B) Admissible, as an excited utterance.\n(C) Inadmissible, because Wilber is no longer employed by Ace.\n\n(D) Inadmissible, unless Ace authorized Wilber to speak on its behalf.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  This question raises the issue of whether an employee's out-of-court statement (\"The accident was my fault; I wasn't paying any attention\") will be attributed to the employer, and thus considered an admission when the employer is a party. The answer is yes, provided the statement was made while the person was employed by the employer (not before or after the period of employment) and provided the statement related to the employment. [Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D)] (A) is correct. Wilber's statement was made while he was employed by Ace Meat Packing Co., and it related to his employment in that it pertained to an accident that occurred when he was driving an Ace truck, presumably in the course of employment. Conversely, (C) is incorrect. That Wilber is no longer employed by Ace does not bear on the admissibility of his statement; what counts is that he was employed by Ace at the time he made the statement. (D) is also incorrect. That Ace may not have authorized Wilber to make the statement does not preclude it from being admissible; what counts is that the statement was made by an employee and related to his employment. Although one basis for attributing an employee's statement to the employer is the employer's authorization for the employee to speak on its behalf [Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(C)], that is not the only basis for treating the employee's statement in such a manner. (B) is incorrect because there is little reason to conclude that Wilber's statement was an \"excited utterance\" within the meaning of that hearsay exception. [Fed. R. Evid. 803(2)] The question does not indicate that Wilber spoke in an excited manner. The words in the statement itself do not suggest that the statement was made while Wilber was agitated. That Wilber spoke shortly after the accident would not alone be sufficient to make his statement an \"excited utterance.\"\n\n",

In 1970, Alice married and left State Red to reside in State Blue. Alice did not return to view the property during her period of residence in State Blue. In 1971, Barry built a driveway on Lot B. The driveway extended three feet over onto Lot A. Barry mistakenly believed that this three-foot strip of land was his property. Barry regularly used the driveway and continued to use it when Alice, having been widowed, returned to State Red in 2002 . Alice discovered the encroachment upon her return.\n\nIf Alice consults you as to her rights against Barry, how should you advise her?\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Alice has no action against Barry, because Barry's title to the three-foot strip has been established by adverse possession.\n\n(B) Alice has no action against Barry, because her prolonged absence from State Red establishes a presumption of abandonment of her rights in the property.\n\n(C) Alice has an action against Barry, because Alice had no knowledge of Barry's encroachment.\n\n(D) Alice has an action against Barry, because Barry mistakenly thought the three-foot strip was his.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Barry had exclusive, continuous possession of the three-foot strip for the requisite statutory period. This possession was open and notorious; i.e., it was possession as an owner would make of the land, and it put the true owner and the community on notice of the fact of possession. This possession was also hostile and under claim of right. Under the majority view, Barry's mistake as to the ownership of the three-foot strip is not determinative. Barry has held under claim of right because his actions appear to the community to be a claim of ownership and he is not holding with permission of the owner. Thus, (D) is incorrect. (C) is incorrect because the open and notorious nature of Barry's possession was sufficient to put the true owner on notice that a possession adverse to the owner's title had been taken.

        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  The facts state that Carter swung the hammer at John \"intending to frighten\" him. Thus, Carter did an act with the intent of causing the apprehension of immediate harmful or offensive contact, i.e., an \"assault.\" Because John was actually hit by the hammer head, the trial court would utilize the transferred intent doctrine to supply the necessary intent for battery. It makes no difference that Carter may not have known that the hammer was defective, because he set in motion the force that injured John; hence, (C) is an improper answer. (B) and (D) are not correct answers because they both go to the issue of a defense, and a person is not privileged to use deadly force against another no matter how provoking the other's mere statements may have been.

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nDr. Wally, a local physician who was prominent in the community and beloved by his patients, died suddenly of a heart attack. Wally was only 46 years old at the time of his death, and so the local newspaper, The Daily Bleat, had never prepared a \"pre-obituary,\" as it did for many prominent figures. Snoops, a reporter with The Daily Bleat, was assigned to write an obituary before the next day's edition went to press. Snoops talked briefly with Mary, Wally's widow, and then called State Medical School, from which Wally had always said he had graduated. As it was late in the afternoon, all the professors were out on the golf course; thus, Snoops spoke with Nina, a secretary in the office of the dean of the medical school. When asked about Wally, Nina replied, \"I don't think Wally ever graduated.\"\n\nIn Snoops's obituary, which appeared in the next morning's Daily Bleat, Snoops had written that Wally had never actually received a medical degree from State Medical School. Upon reading the obituary, Mary broke into tears and then became very angry, for she had worked hard to help put Wally through State Medical School, from which Wally had, in fact, graduated with high honors. Wally's executor, Eddie, was equally incensed. Both Eddie and Mary called The Daily Bleat, demanding a retraction. The next day, on the front page, The Daily Bleat admitted its error and stated that Wally graduated with high honors from State Medical School. They also fired Snoops. Nonetheless, both Eddie and Mary sued The Daily Bleat for defamation.\n\nWhat is The Daily Bleat's best defense?\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  There was no malice on the part of the defendant.\n(B) The newspaper's retraction negated any harm.\n(C) Snoops got his information from a secre- tary at the Medical School.\n(D) Wally is dead.\n\n\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "(A)  The Daily Bleat's best defense is that Dr. Wally is dead. Only living persons can be defamed; defamation of a deceased person is not an actionable tort. Thus, because Dr. Wally is dead, The Daily Bleat can obtain dismissal of the defamation action without having to establish any defamation defenses. Therefore, (D) is correct. (A) is not as good a defense as (D) because, in order to use the defense of absence of malice, the newspaper would have to establish that Dr. Wally was a public figure, which would be more difficult than showing that the doctor is dead. Moreover, it is not conclusive from the facts that Dr. Wally is a public figure as defined by the Gertz case (someone of pervasive fame or who is involved in a particular public controversy), since the facts merely state that he was prominent in the community. (B) is incorrect because a retraction, while it may show lack of actual malice in mitigation of damages, would not necessarily eliminate all of the harm to Dr. Wally's reputation. The fact that the retraction ran the next day on the front page gives the newspaper a better case, but it is not as good a defense as the fact that Wally is dead. (C) is incorrect because the fact that Snoops got his information from a secretary at the Medical School does not preclude liability for defamation. At most, that fact may be asserted to disprove malice if Dr. Wally was a public figure or negligence if the doctor's death was a matter of public concern. However, even assuming that one of these standards applies, Snoops may still be at fault for not having obtained a more authoritative statement from someone at the Medical School.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nThe state legislature of Nevada enacted legislation prohibiting the use of tractor-trailer rigs weighing more than 100,000 pounds gross, after lengthy hearings demonstrated to the legislators' satisfaction that superheavy trucks rapidly degrade the state's roadways and pose a greater safety danger than smaller trucks. Western States Freight, a trucking firm that frequently uses Nevada highways for trips between Colorado and California, has recently purchased several tractor-trailer rigs weighing over 100,000 pounds when loaded. Most of its equipment may still be legally used in Nevada, but the firm does not want to have to exclude the superheavies from the California runs and plans to gradually replace its older trucks with larger models. Western brings an action for declaratory relief in federal court in Colorado, seeking to have the Nevada legislation declared unconstitutional. The state of Nevada asserts that the legislation is justified as an exercise of the state's police power based upon safety considerations, and that the court may not second-guess the state legislators as to this subject. None of the evidence presented at the legislative hearings is produced in court. Western presents expert testimony that the heavier trucks are no less safe than smaller models.\n\nThe trial court should rule:\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  That the legislation is an unconstitutional violation of Western's Fourteenth Amend- ment rights to due process of law.\n(B) That the legislation is unconstitutional because it violates the Commerce Clause.\n(C) That the legislation is a valid exercise of the state's police power to regulate high- way safety.\n(D) That the evidence of the damage done to the state's highways by the superheavy trucks is sufficient to uphold the legislation independently of the safety argument.\n\n\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "(A)  As a general matter, a state may regulate in ways that impact on interstate commerce as long as the regulation does so only indirectly and the benefits outweigh the burdens imposed by compliance with the regulation. [Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp. (1981)] When, as here, only a bare assertion that the regulation would increase safety is involved, a court will generally find that the regulation is invalid. This does not mean that a state could not prevail if it proved that the benefits of the regulation do in fact outweigh the burdens. Indeed, the Court intimated that such would be the case in Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc. (1959). But Nevada has not made a sufficient showing here, and Western has presented colorable \"expert\" evidence to the contrary. (A) is incorrect because economic and social regulations are tested at the rational basis level for due process purposes, and even the minimal showing here would suffice for the state. (C) states a correct premise (i.e., that the state is regulating for highway safety), but an incorrect result, and is wrong. (D) is wrong because the state has in fact made no such showing before the court. Thus, while there is a normal presumption of constitutionality, the state here has not met its burden in defending the measure in the face of contrary, expert evidence.\n\n",

Other crimes are admissible on identity when they are committed in a very unique way that shows what amounts to a \"signature\" of the perpetrator. Theoretically, even signature crimes can be excluded if the judge determines that the probative value is substantially outweighed by prejudice.

Shelley owned several small, single-family residences in City, which she rented to various student groups and families. One such rental, a small, furnished two-bedroom house located in one of the poorer sections of City, had been rented to a young married couple for several months when Shelley failed to receive the monthly rent check. She drove by the house several times for two weeks and received no answer to her knocks. Neighbors told her that they had not seen the couple for at least three weeks. Finally, Shelley used her keys to enter the house. She discovered that the old set of dishware and utensils she had permitted the couple to use was still in the kitchen, but that there was no food in the house and all but a few old items of clothing had been removed from the closets. Concluding that the couple had abandoned the rental without paying the last month's rent, Shelley called the power company and had the electricity and gas shut off until she could find another tenant.\n\nA week later, the couple returned from an extended visit to the young wife's sick mother in Mexico. When they found that their power had been turned off, they reported this to the authorities and Shelley was prosecuted under the misdemeanor statute. At trial, it was established that the couple had inadvertently failed to place the proper postage on the rent check, which they had mailed from Mexico, and it had eventually been returned by Mexican postal authorities to the wife's mother's residence.\n\nShelley will probably be:\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Convicted, because the charged crime is violation of a public safety statute, and she is strictly liable for her action in turning off the power.\n\n(B) Convicted, because she did not undertake a more thorough inquiry or wait a more reasonable length of time before concluding that the house had been abandoned.\n\n(C) Acquitted, if the trier of fact concludes that Shelley was reasonable in believing that the house had been abandoned.\n\n(D) Acquitted, if the trier of fact concludes that the young couple was negligent in not placing proper postage on the rent check mailed from Mexico.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Shelley would be acquitted if the jury found that she was reasonable in believing that the house was abandoned. Under the terms of the statute, the actor must \"willfully shut off the gas ... to an inhabited dwelling.\" The requirement of an inhabited dwelling is a material element of the crime. A reasonable mistake about a material element will negate criminal liability for all crimes except strict liability offenses. This is not a strict liability offense since a mental state of willfulness is required. Thus, if Shelley reasonably believed that the house was abandoned, she made a reasonable mistake about whether it was an \"inhabited dwelling,\" and she should be found not guilty. (A) is wrong because, as mentioned, this is not a strict liability offense; willfulness is required. (B) is not as good an answer as (C) because there is no specific amount of time that she must wait before reasonably concluding that the house has been abandoned. (B) assumes that the jury will find her actions unreasonable, but it is also possible that they will find her actions reasonable. (D) is wrong because if all the elements of the statute were present, Shelley would not be excused from criminal liability simply because the couple had been negligent in mailing the rent check.\n\n",

        "Explanation": "(A)  At common law, murder was the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought could be established with any one of the following states of mind: intent to kill; intent to cause serious bodily harm; the depraved heart killing (a reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life); or the commission of a felony. It is unlikely the defendant in (A) would be found guilty of murder. The defendant's action does not indicate the depraved heart mental state. There clearly was no intent to kill, intent to cause bodily harm, or commission of a felony. In (B), the defendant's crime would most likely be classified as voluntary manslaughter in light of the provoking event and subsequent heat of passion. It is unlikely the defendant in (C) would be guilty of murder. While the defendant's action might be classified as negligent or even reckless, it would not represent a depraved heart-reckless indifference to life state of mind. (D) represents the fact pattern where the defendant is most likely guilty of murder. Firing a gun into a house would demonstrate a reckless indifference to a high risk to human life.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nThe United States General Accounting Office issued a call for competitive bids for a contract to supply the National Park Service with 3,000 four-wheel drive utility vehicles; the detailed specifications for the vehicles were included in the announcement. Auto Modifiers, Inc., of the state of Midwest won the contract as low bidder and began manufacture of the vehicles. Midwest statutes require that automobiles manufactured in that state be equipped with certain antipollution devices and have a maximum displacement of 2,500 cubic centimeters. The specifications of the federal contract require Auto Modifiers to manufacture the utility vehicles without the antipollution devices and with engines with a displacement of 4,000 cubic centimeters. When the president of Auto Modifiers learns that the Midwest Attorney General's office is investigating the manufacture of the government vehicles, he instructs his legal department to take affirmative action to protect the company. Auto Modifiers then files suit in state court for declaratory relief, seeking a judicial declaration that the state statute prescribing antipollution devices and engine size may not be enforced as to it.\n\nThe court should rule:\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  The statute may not constitutionally be applied to Auto Modifiers in this instance because to do so would violate the $\\mathrm{Su}-$ premacy Clause.\n\n(B) The statute may not constitutionally be applied to Auto Modifiers because to do so would violate the Contracts Clause.\n\n(C) The statute may not constitutionally be applied to Auto Modifiers because to do so would violate the Commerce Clause.\n\n(D) All of the above.\n\n\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Since the state statute conflicts with the terms of the federal contract, the federal contract must take precedence, pursuant to the Supremacy Clause and principles of federal immunity from state regulation. $(\\mathrm{B})$ is not a good answer because there are no facts indicating that the statute was enacted after the contract was formed; in fact, the problem implies that the reverse is true. (C) is not the best answer because, although it is possible that a state's regulation of the manufacture of goods might affect interstate commerce so as to invoke the commerce power, the facts of this problem do not indicate any likelihood of such a circumstance, and are insufficient to be conclusive anyway.

Wyoming state law grants each county great autonomy in setting the health standards governing the preparation, packaging, transportation, and sale of foodstuffs. The Pecos County council recently enacted an ordinance, valid under the constitution and statutes of Wyoming, prohibiting the packaging and sale of any food item in any nonbiodegradable material; the ordinance defines nonbiodegradable and specifically lists as prohibited all forms of plastics, cellophane, or similar materials. The ordinance specifically exempts from its terms sales of food to public institutions such as hospitals, jails, and schools.\n\nSnak-Mart, a retail food seller in East Rabbit's Foot, files an appropriate court action attacking the Pecos County ordinance on the grounds that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Since there appears to be a rational basis for the challenged legislationprotecting the environment and the citizenry from the effects of potentially permanent artificial materials-the law is valid. (A) is incorrect because it assumes that the state must use the least restrictive alternative, but that is not required except when strict scrutiny is used. There is no basis for such review under the facts of this question because there is neither a suspect classification nor a fundamental right. $(\\mathrm{B})$ is wrong for the same reason: under equal protection analysis, a \"compelling purpose\" is required only when strict scrutiny is used. Challenges to economic regulations are subjected only to a rational basis test. (C) is incorrect because whether Congress has entered the field is irrelevant to an equal protection analysis.

Nimrod was hunting on private land, but the elk was 200 yards away, inside a fence that surrounded a federal military base. Nimrod shot the elk from where he was standing, but entered the military base to retrieve the carcass. Nimrod took the carcass away and had it dressed and frozen for Nimrod's meals through the winter. A federal statute prohibits the removal of wild animals or the carcasses thereof from United States military bases. Nimrod is prosecuted under the statute.\n\nThe best argument in favor of upholding the statute as constitutional would be based on:\n",

        "Explanation": "(A)  Absent consent or cession, a state retains jurisdiction over federal lands within its territory. However, Congress also retains the power to enact legislation respecting such lands, pursuant to the Property Clause. When Congress so acts, the federal legislation necessarily overrides conflicting state laws under the Supremacy Clause. Here, the laws of the state of West permit Nimrod to hunt in the state. However, under the Supremacy Clause, the federal statute overrides West's law with respect to matters involving the federal military base which is located in West. The power to raise and maintain an army and navy does not necessarily include the right to regulate certain property. Thus, (B) is wrong. The Commerce Clause could possibly be a proper basis for upholding the statute, but there is nothing in the facts indicating that Congress has exercised the commerce power in this manner. (A) is therefore a better answer. (D) is wrong because the Privileges and Immunities Clause applies to state action.\n\n",

The city of Owenoak applied for funding to build housing and received a grant of $\\$ 2.5$ million.

        "Explanation": "(A)  The court will likely deny the motion because Congress generally has the power to condition federal spending if Congress reasonably finds that the spending program is for the general welfare. (A) is incorrect because the federal government determines how the funds are to be expended, not the recipient. Thus, while it may be arguable that the city's plan is a better way to use the money, the fact remains that the money was given for one purpose only and it must be expended for that purpose. Hence, $(\\mathrm{B})$ is wrong because the federal government in this situation does have the authority to control the spending of its funds and it is not an interference with the state's sovereign powers.

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nUnder which of the following circumstances would the named defendant be least likely to be convicted of the charged offense?\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Walter, a chemical engineer, painstakingly constructs an explosive device from readily available materials and secretes it beneath the house where his ex-wife and her boyfriend are living. He waits until he is sure both have had time to get home from their jobs, and then detonates the device by remote control, totally demolishing the house. Unknown to Walter, his ex-wife and her boyfriend had impulsively decided to spend the evening at a motel downtown. Walter is charged with attempted murder.\n\n(B) Yvette attempts to charge an expensive leather coat using a credit card that her boyfriend obtained when he stole a woman's purse. The store's electronic credit reporting system indicates the account is defunct, and the store clerk refuses to complete the transaction. Yvette is charged with attempting to obtain property by false pretenses.\n\n(C) Hazel, seeing a well-heeled couple cross the park, decides to rob them and use the money for groceries. Hazel approaches the couple, pulls out a gun, and tells them to hand over all of their money and valuables. The couple was having an unusually bad day: they had just been mugged five minutes before and were on their way to notify the police when Hazel approached them. Consequently, they had no money or valuables. Hazel is charged with attempted robbery.\n\n(D) Farley, a married man who believes adultery to be a felony, begins a torrid affair with Edna, his best friend's wife. Unknown to either of them, the jurisdiction they reside in has a statute that expressly makes noncriminal any sexual act between consenting adults in private. Farley is charged with attempted adultery.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "(A)  To convict for attempt, the prosecutor must establish that the defendant (i) had the specific intent to commit the crime; and (ii) engaged in behavior that constituted a substantial step toward commission of the crime and was strongly corroborative of the defendant's criminal purpose. In (A), Walter could be found guilty of attempted murder. He had the specific intent to kill, and the jury could find he took a substantial step toward commission of the crime. In (B), Yvette could be found guilty of attempting to obtain property by false pretenses. She had the specific intent to commit the crime, and the jury could find she took a substantial step toward commission of it. In (C), Hazel could be found guilty of attempted robbery; she had the specific intent, and the jury could find the necessary act. In (D), Farley could not be guilty of attempt. Since the activity he was engaging in, and intending to engage in, is not illegal, he cannot be found guilty of attempt even if he thought he was engaging in criminal conduct. This is the doctrine of legal impossibility.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nTo protect the minor children living in the area, the Rock Creek Town Council enacted an ordinance that prohibited advertisements that include \"a depiction of a nude person, whether male or female.\" Sylvester Screen owns and operates Rock Creek Video, a videotape rental shop. Screen often posts large posters to advertise movies he has available for rent. A substantial part of his business consists of the rental of \"X-rated\" movies. These adult tapes are kept in a separate part of the shop. In the adult tape room he hangs movie advertisements, many of them depicting nude or partially nude people. Screen does not allow minors to enter the adult tape room.\n\nIf Screen challenges the ordinance, and assuming that he has standing to sue, how will the court most likely rule? ",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  For the town, because the ordinance is a valid exercise of the town's power to protect the morals of its minor citizens.\n\n(B) For Screen, because prohibiting the posting of the movie advertisements violates his First Amendment rights.\n\n(C) For the town, because the posters may appeal to a minor's prurient interest in sex.\n\n(D) For Screen, because not all nudity is obscene.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "(A)  This ordinance is too broad. The Supreme Court has defined obscenity as a description or depiction of sexual conduct that taken as a whole, by the average person, applying contemporary community standards, appeals to the prurient interest in sex, portrays sex in a patently offensive way, and using a reasonable person standard, does not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Thus, under this definition, not all nudity is obscene. (A) is incorrect because although the town may try to protect its minors, that purpose does not allow it to prohibit all such advertisements. The ordinance is too broad to be valid and its purpose will not save it. (B) is incorrect because if the posters fall within the Court's definition of obscenity, they could be prohibited because obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment. (C) is incorrect because the \"average person\" in the above definition does not include children.\n\n",

        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Albert's statement is a vicarious admission by a party-opponent. The statement acknowledges significant consumption of alcohol, which could have contributed to the accident. Under the Federal Rules, statements by an agent concerning a matter within the scope of his agency, made during the existence of the relationship, is nonhearsay. Thus, Albert's admission of drinking is admissible against his employer, and (D) is therefore incorrect. (A) is incorrect because the statement against interest exception requires that the declarant be unavailable as a witness. The facts do not indicate that Albert is unavailable. (C) is incorrect because the excited utterance exception requires that the statement concern the immediate facts of the startling occurrence. Albert's admission of drinking does not concern the immediate facts of the accident.

As he was leaving the store, he noticed that Actress, a well-known Hollywood starlet, was browsing through the women's clothing department in Department Store. Photog took a picture of Actress in the clothing department without Actress's knowledge. Several days later, Photog took the photograph to the manager of Department Store and sold him the picture, explaining that Actress had agreed that Department Store could use the photograph in an advertising campaign. The manager enlarged the photograph and hung it above the main entrance to Department Store with a caption that read, \"The store where Actress shops.\" One month earlier, Actress had entered into a contract with Hardware Store, the terms of which provided that Hardware Store had the exclusive right to use Actress's name and likeness for advertising purposes. As a result of the photograph's appearing at Department Store, Hardware Store canceled its contract with Actress.\n\nIf Actress asserts a claim based on invasion of privacy against Department Store, will Actress prevail?\n\n",

        "Explanation": "(A)  Where plaintiff is well-known, so that her name and likeness have commercial value, using plaintiff's name or likeness for commercial purposes without permission is an invasion of privacy. (B) is wrong. There is generally no violation of one's right of privacy when her picture is taken in a public place. (C) is wrong. In the absence of actual consent or some other recognized privilege, the appropriation is actionable. Department Store's good faith belief that consent was obtained is no defense. (D) is wrong because Actress's status as a public figure bolsters this type of invasion of privacy charge (commercial appropriation) rather than diminishes it.\n\n",

        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Defendant is charged with battery after wounding Hal by shooting him. Defendant claims that he was too drunk to realize that anyone was in the house into which he shot.\n\n(B) Defendant is charged with manslaughter when he hit and killed a child while riding his motorcycle. Defendant claims that he was so drunk he did not see the child in time to avoid hitting her.\n\n(C) Defendant is charged with larceny. Defendant claims that when he took the car he was too drunk to realize that it was not his.\n\n(D) Defendant is charged with involuntary manslaughter after her unsupervised fouryear-old child was killed in a fire at their home. Defendant claims that she was at the corner bar, drunk, when the fire occurred.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Larceny is a specific intent crime that requires that the defendant intend to permanently deprive the owner of his property. If Defendant can show that he really believed the car to be his own, there is no intent to deprive the owner of his property, and, therefore, Defendant is not guilty of larceny. (A) is wrong because battery is a general intent crime that can arise out of a showing of gross negligence. Shooting at a residence is gross negligence and can support a finding of battery even if the defendant does not know that anyone is home. $(\\mathrm{B})$ is obviously wrong because the defendant's criminal act does not lie in the fact that he did not see the child in time, but in the fact that he was driving while intoxicated, and it was his intoxication (grossly negligent conduct) that caused him to be unable to see the child in time. (D) is an interesting problem. The defendant in this case was drunk at the corner bar when the child was killed, so it cannot be determined whether this defendant was the cause of the fire. However, a parent has an obligation at common law to supervise and protect her children. Since the defendant left this child alone and unsupervised, it is possible that the defendant could be charged with involuntary manslaughter when the child was accidentally killed. The fact that she was intoxicated at the time would not be a defense to a charge of involuntary manslaughter arising out of the fact that this child was left alone.\n\n",

She visited Dealership, a Rolls-Royce dealer, several times, looked at many cars, and discussed possible sales prices with Huck, a salesman. On May 15, after much discussion, Huck and Mom signed a writing that stated, \"If we can agree on price on or before June 1, Mom agrees to buy and Huck, for Dealership, agrees to sell one yellow Rolls-Royce Silver Streak, serial number XO857623.\" On May 20, Mom dispatched a letter to Huck stating, \"I will buy the Rolls-Royce for $\\$ 150,000$.\" On the same day, Huck dispatched a letter to Mom, stating, \"I will sell the Rolls-Royce for $\\$ 150,000$.\"\n\nHas a valid contract been formed between Dealership and Mom?\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Yes, because the May 15 writing constitutes a contract with a missing price term, and that term was filled by the crossing offers.\n\n(B) Yes, because when two crossing offers are identical in import, one will be treated as an offer and the other as an acceptance.\n\n(C) No, because there were two crossing offers and no acceptance; hence there was no mutual assent.\n\n(D) No, but the result would be different if Mom were a merchant.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  If offers stating precisely the same terms cross in the mail, they do not give rise to a contract. An offer cannot be accepted if there is no knowledge of it. The letters sent by Mom and Huck constitute crossing offers, of which there was no acceptance. Thus, there is no contract. (B) is incorrect; it is a misstatement of the law. (A) is incorrect because, under the U.C.C., a reasonable price will be supplied by the court unless the parties have shown that they do not want a contract until they have agreed on price. Here, the May 15 writing indicates that Mom and Huck did not intend to be contractually bound until they agreed on a price.

She saw a car speeding off into the distance and found a badly injured Victor lying in the street. Victor gasped to Moms, \"I'm going to die. The car that hit me had license number DD666!\" Victor then lapsed into unconsciousness. Moms gave her information to the police, including a description of the car and Victor's comment on the license plate. Police traced the registration to Dick Devilish. Victor recovered from his injuries but now suffers permanent disabilities. Victor filed suit against Devilish for his injuries. At the trial, Victor wants to have Moms testify as to Victor's statement regarding Devilish's license number.\n\nThe court should rule that such testimony by Moms is:\n\n",

(C) Admissible, as a declaration made in belief of impending death.\n\n(D) Admissible, as an excited utterance.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Moms's proposed testimony about Victor's statement ('I'm going to die. The car that hit me had license number DD666!\") is hearsay evidence. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement. [Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)] Since it appears that Victor's statement is being offered to establish that the car that hit him had license number DD666, it is hearsay. Nevertheless, it is admissible under the \"excited utterance\" exception to the hearsay rule. Hence, (D) is correct. At first glance it might seem that the \"dying declaration\" exception to the hearsay rule applies as well. [See Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(2)] There is no indication, however, that the declarant (Victor) is unavailable to testify, a prerequisite for admitting evidence under the dying declaration exception. [Fed. R. Evid. 804(a)] Victor is a party and thus would seem to be available to testify. If Victor were to testify that he had no memory as to the license number, he would be considered unavailable [Fed. R. Evid. 804(a)(3)], but there is no indication that Victor has so testified. Therefore, the dying declaration exception does not apply, and (C) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because Moms's proposed testimony is admissible under the hearsay exception for \"excited utterances.\" [Fed. R. Evid. 803(2)] This hearsay exception, like most, does not require the declarant to be unavailable as a condition for the admission of hearsay evidence. It merely requires that the hearsay statement relate to a startling event or condition, made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. Victor's statement relates to a startling event (the car crash) that prompted the statement. Because the statement was made so soon after the crash, while Victor was badly injured, it probably constitutes an excited utterance. Moms's testimony is highly probative in establishing that Dick Devilish was driving the car that struck Victor. (A) is incorrect in asserting that Moms's testimony is inadmissible because it is more prejudicial than probative. Moms's testimony is in no sense unfairly prejudicial to Devilish.\n\n",

Violators Will Be Prosecuted.\" Mary was tired after a long day at work, and deciding that she could not wait until she got home, she lit a cigarette. The bus driver shouted, \"Read the sign, lady; put that out or get off my bus!\" Mary told the bus driver, \"I've had a rough day; you can go to hell,\" and walked to the back of the bus and took a seat. The bus driver flagged down a passing police officer and told him that Mary was smoking on the bus (which was the misdemeanor of \"disorderly conduct\"). Mary, meanwhile, quickly extinguished the cigarette and put the butt in her purse so that by the time the police officer had boarded the bus, she was sitting there innocently chewing a breath mint. The officer told Mary that she was charged with disorderly conduct, and then he searched her purse and the coat that she was carrying. The officer found not only the recently extinguished cigarette butt, but also a marijuana cigarette in the coat pocket. Mary was then charged with possession of a controlled substance.\n\nAt Mary's trial for possession, should the marijuana cigarette be admitted over Mary's objection?\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Yes, because it was obtained in a search incident to a valid arrest.\n\n(B) Yes, because the coat was within Mary's \"wingspan\" or reach.\n\n(C) No, because the arrest was invalid.\n\n(D) No, because the police officer did not give Mary Miranda warnings.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  There are six exceptions to the warrant requirement. The only exception applicable to this case is a search incident to a lawful arrest. However, if an arrest is unlawful, then any search incident to that arrest is also unlawful. At common law a police officer could not make a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor unless it was committed in his presence. While it is unclear whether a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor not committed in the officer's presence would violate the Fourth Amendment, practically all states follow the common law rule. Because Mary did not commit the misdemeanor of disorderly conduct in the presence of the officer, his arrest and accompanying search were invalid. It follows that (A) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because it simply states the geographic scope of a search incident to a lawful arrest. (D) is incorrect because Miranda warnings, which protect a person's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, do not generally affect seizure of evidence, and would not affect the seizure in this case.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nShelley and Herman decided to get married. Both were in their final year of high school; Shelley was one month short of her 18th birthday, and Herman was 19 . They went to a local jeweler and looked at gold wedding bands, but saw nothing that appealed to them. When they discovered that the jeweler was himself a goldsmith and could make rings to order, they described what they were interested in and signed a purchase order for two rings; a woman's band for $\\$ 500$ and a man's for $\\$ 650$.\n\nThree weeks later, the jeweler called Shelley and informed her that the rings were ready. In the meantime, she and Herman had broken up and Herman had enlisted in the Marines and been sent to another state for training. The day after her 18th birthday, Shelley went to the jeweler and told him that they would not be needing the rings. When he protested that they were custom-made and would probably not sell to anyone else, Shelley said, \"All right, I've got $\\$ 400$ in my savings account. I'll take my ring, but you'll have to find Herman about the other one.\" The jeweler had Shelley sign another purchase order for the woman's band at $\\$ 400$, payment to be made by the end of the month.\n\nWhen the jeweler did not hear from Shelley after another month, he brought an action for breach of contract against her. Evidence produced at trial established that the market value of the rings was $\\$ 500$ and $\\$ 650$ for the woman's and man's, respectively, and that the age of majority in the jurisdiction was 18.\n\nIs the jeweler entitled to recover against Shelley?\n",

        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  The jeweler is entitled to recover $\\$ 400$ because, upon attaining the age of majority, Shelley affirmed the contract as to her ring at that price. Infants generally lack legal capacity to incur binding contractual obligations. Contracts entered into by infants are voidable at this election unless the contract is for a \"necessity.\" On reaching majority, an infant may affirm; i.e., choose to be bound by her contract. Here, at the time of entering into the contract for the two rings, Shelley was not yet 18 years old (the applicable age of majority). Because a wedding ring is not a necessity, Shelley's contract was voidable at her option. However, when Shelley went back to see the jeweler, she had reached the age of 18 . At that time, she chose to be bound by the contract, although her affirmation was limited to her ring (instead of both rings), and to a lower price for her ring than that which was originally agreed upon. When a voidable promise is reaffirmed, the promise will be enforced according to the terms of the reaffirmation rather than the original obligation. Thus, Shelley is now bound by her contract, but only for the purchase of $\\boldsymbol{h e r}$ ring at a price of $\\$ 400$. (D) is incorrect because it ignores the fact that, having affirmed the contract (albeit at different terms), Shelley, who is no longer an infant, is bound to the terms of the reaffirmed contract. (A) is incorrect because $\\$ 1,150$ reflects the purchase price of both rings as contained in the original contract. Upon reaching majority, Shelley chose not to be bound by the original contract. Similarly, (B) is incorrect because $\\$ 500$ reflects the purchase price of Shelley's ring as contained in the original agreement (as well as the market value of the ring). Upon reaching majority, Shelley could have refused to pay anything. She is now bound only to the contract as affirmed by her, which is for $\\$ 400$.\n\n",

Dimer, the chief personnel officer of the New Lancashire State Police, put out a memo inviting all white New Lancashire police officers to apply for the undercover position. Pendergrass had been a New Lancashire State Police officer for eight years and had received many citations for efficiency, bravery, and public service.

The government, based on the facts, has a compelling interest in infiltrating the racist group. Due to the nature of the group, a white police officer is obviously necessary for this task. This means the action meets both elements of the strict scrutiny test: the interest is compelling and the means selected are narrowly tailored since no other nondiscriminatory action would work.

Strict scrutiny always is employed. (C) is incorrect because even discriminatory conduct is permissible if it is necessary to achieve a compelling government interest and the means selected are narrowly tailored.

It is true that Red may not continue to occupy the land and that he is free of his rent obligation, but he will share in the condemnation award. III. is correct. Since the leasehold interest is a property interest, Red has a constitutional right to compensation for the property interest taken through eminent domain. Compensation will be determined by the value of the estate, less the rent Red no longer is required to pay. Thus, (C) is correct, and (A), (B), and (D) are wrong.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nThe Social Security Act provided that surviving spouses and stepchildren would be denied benefits unless the decedent wage-earner spouse had been married at least nine months prior to death. Sal married her husband, who was in apparent good health, five months before his death. Sal was denied survivor benefits by the Social Security Administration. She now brings an action to compel the Social Security Administration to award her benefits.\n\nThe decision of the court should be that:\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Sal should be awarded benefits, because the nine-month period is arbitrary, capricious, and without any rational justification.\n\n(B) Sal should be awarded benefits, because the classification is an invidious scheme and violates her rights to equal protection.\n\n(C) Sal should not be given benefits, because the nine-month period in question is reasonably calculated to achieve a permissible governmental end. (D) Sal should not be awarded benefits, because it would be an undue burden on the public treasury to allow all wives survivor benefits.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Sal should not be given benefits. The Supreme Court in Weinberger $v$. Salfi (1975) held that the government does not have to show a compelling reason for denying noncontractual benefits. Sal's rights were noncontractual, and the only obligation of the government was to show that the classification of nine months served some proper governmental purpose. The Court stated that the purpose behind the requirement is to prevent sham marriages (i.e., those solely to qualify for benefits). Thus, (A) and (B) are wrong. (D) is wrong. It implies that distinctions predicated on gender are appropriate in the face of a claim that more women than men would qualify for the benefits, a proposition the Court has rejected on numerous occasions.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nPops, owner of a street corner candy store, heard several gunshots and rushed out in the street. He found Velma lying on the sidewalk, bleeding profusely. She gasped to Pops, \"I'm going to die. Danny Deft shot me.\" Velma lapsed into unconsciousness and died on the way to the hospital without uttering another word. Danny Deft was arrested and charged with the murder of Velma. At Deft's trial, the prosecution seeks to have Pops testify as to Velma's statement.\n\nSuch testimony should be ruled:\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Inadmissible, because it is more prejudicial than probative.\n\n(B) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\n\n(C) Admissible, as a declaration made in belief of impending death.\n\n(D) Admissible, as an excited utterance.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Pops's proposed testimony about Velma's statement (\"I'm going to die. Danny Deft shot me.\") is hearsay evidence. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement. [Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)] Since it appears that Velma's statement is being offered to establish that Danny did the shooting, it is hearsay. Nevertheless, it is admissible under the \"dying declaration\" exception to the hearsay rule. For a dying declaration to be admissible, two prerequisites must be met: (i) The declarant must be unavailable to testify. [Fed. R. Evid. 804(a)] Velma, being dead, obviously is unavailable to testify. (ii) A dying declaration can only be admitted in certain kinds of cases - homicide prosecutions and civil cases. [Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(2)] This is an appropriate case, a murder prosecution. This hearsay exception further requires that the declarant's statement be made while believing her death to be imminent, and that the statement concern the cause or circumstances of what the declarant believed to be impending death. [Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(2)] Velma believed her death was imminent. She was bleeding profusely from being shot and gasped, \"I' $\\mathrm{m}$ going to die.\" In addition, her statement (\"Danny Deft shot me\") pertained to the cause or circumstances of her death. Pops's proposed testimony might also be admissible under the hearsay exception for \"excited utterances.\" Rule 803(2) makes admissible a hearsay statement relating to a startling event or condition, made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. Certainly one could argue that Velma's statement was an excited utterance. But the question does not make clear that her statement was made while under the stress of excitement. Thus, while (D) is a plausible answer, $(\\mathrm{C})$ is better because Velma's statement fits so precisely within the dying declaration exception to the hearsay rule. $(\\mathrm{B})$ is clearly wrong because it asserts that the statement does not fit within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule. (A) is wrong. Pops's testimony obviously would be highly probative in establishing that Danny murdered Velma. (A) nonetheless asserts that the testimony should be inadmissible because it is more prejudicial than probative. This answer is incorrect because it fundamentally misconceives the concept of prejudice in the context of the Rule 403 probative value/prejudicial impact balancing test. The only kind of prejudice that can properly be balanced under this test is unfair prejudice. The \"prejudice\" surrounding the admission of Pops's testimony is not in any sense unfair; it is merely the natural result of any evidence having such persuasive force. In other words, it is prejudicial only in the sense that it will harm Danny's defense because it is highly probative of the fact that Danny killed Velma.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nA construction crew for the Municipal Telephone Company was sent out to install new fiberoptic cables at a downtown intersection on a vacant lot where an old building that had been demolished had stood. The telephone workers had to dig out the old copper cables, install new sheathing, and then connect and insert the new cables. Because they ran into some portions of the old sidewalk that had been in front of the old building and that had been buried over the years, the excavating took much longer than planned, and by the end of the day they had just finished removing the old copper cables. The foreman of \n\n\\section{MIXED SUBJECTS 209.}\n\nthe crew put up a couple of wooden barriers around the trench, which was about 12 feet deep, 6 feet wide, and 30 feet long, and posted signs on each of the barriers reading, \"Open trench, do not approach.\"\n\nMarcus and a few friends had been playing basketball after they got out of their seventh grade classes and passed by the excavation on their way home. Marcus could not quite make out what the signs on the barriers said in the deepening dusk, so he walked over to the nearest one and read it. His friends, who had continued walking, called for him to hurry along, and as he ran toward where they had moved ahead on the street, the soft edge of the excavation gave way and Marcus fell into the trench, severely injuring himself.\n\nIf Marcus's mother brings an action against the telephone company, what will be the probable outcome of her litigation? Assume that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence and assumption of risk rules.\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  She will lose, because the construction foreman posted a warning notice that Marcus read and understood.\n\n(B) She will lose, because Marcus assumed the risk of injury when, after reading the warning notice, he carelessly ran along the trench after his friends.\n\n(C) She will win, if the trier of fact concludes that the construction crew was negligent in leaving the open trench without additional protection for passersby.\n\n(D) She will win, because the telephone company is strictly liable for the injuries to Marcus.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  If the telephone company is found to be negligent, it will be liable despite the posting of warning notices. A finding of negligence establishes the prima facie elements of duty and breach in a negligence action. The other elements of actual cause, proximate cause, and damages are indicated by the facts. As discussed below, the telephone company's defenses to negligence will not be successful; hence, Marcus's mother will win. (A) is incorrect because Marcus appears to have been attracted to the trench by the warning sign, which was not readable from the street, and he was injured only while attempting to leave the site of the excavation. Therefore, his conduct in walking up to the sign was not contributorily negligent, nor did he knowingly and voluntarily assume any risk by reading the sign. (B) is wrong because assumption of risk requires that plaintiff know of the risk as well as voluntarily assume it. Marcus cannot be said to have known of a risk that the edge of the excavation would give way. Although knowledge may be implied where the risk is one that the average person would clearly appreciate, the court will take into account the plaintiff's age and any other relevant circumstances. It is unlikely that a court would find that an average seventh-grader would appreciate the unstable nature of the edge of the trench in the dusk. (D) is incorrect because strict liability would only be imposed if excavations were considered ultrahazardous or abnormally dangerous activities. For an activity to be ultrahazardous, it (i) must involve a risk of serious harm to persons or property, (ii) must not be capable of being performed with complete safety no matter how much care is taken, and (iii) must not be a commonly engaged-in activity in the community. Although involving a risk of serious harm, an excavation generally is not classified as an ultrahazardous activity because it can be done safely and is a fairly common activity. (Note that even if you were not sure whether courts treated excavations as ultrahazardous activities, (C) would be the better choice because the only difficult issue in a negligence action under these facts is breach of duty, and that is resolved by the additional facts in the choice.)\n\n",

Winnie would agree to a sale for $\\$ 40,000$.\n\n\n If Winnie in fact has a half interest in the racing car:\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  There is no enforceable contract because the car cannot be sold unless both owners convey title.\n\n(B) There is an enforceable contract only if Bob was unaware of Winnie's interest when he signed with Sam.\n\n(C) There is an enforceable contract regardless of whether Bob was aware of Winnie's interest at the time he signed.\n\n(D) The contract is discharged by prospective inability of performance.\n\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Sam's unconditional promise to sell created a contract even if Bob knew of Winnie's interest. When a promise is unconditional, the failure to perform according to its terms is a breach of contract. By not making his promise conditional on Winnie's consent to convey her interest, Sam impliedly undertook to obtain her consent. Therefore, the contract is enforceable. (Note that this does not necessarily mean that Bob will be able to get the car; he may have to settle for damages because of Winnie's interest.) (A) is incorrect although partially true. It is true that Sam cannot sell Winnie's half of the car without her consent; however, that does not make the contract here unenforceable. As stated above, by making his promise unconditional, Sam undertook a duty to obtain Winnie's consent to sell the car. His failure to do so is a breach of contract, but a breach does not negate a contract; it merely gives the nonbreaching party a right to certain remedies. Therefore, the contract is enforceable, even if Winnie refuses to sell her interest. (B) is incorrect because Bob's knowledge of Winnie's interest is irrelevant to the issue of the contract's enforceability. As discussed above, Sam's unconditional promise implied that Sam would obtain Winnie's consent to convey her interest in the car. Therefore, the contract is enforceable regardless of whether Bob was aware of Winnie's interest at the time he signed. (D) is incorrect because \"prospective inability\" is not a ground for discharge. Prospective failure of consideration occurs when a party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other party will be unable or unwilling to perform when due. The prospective inability of performance does not discharge the contract; rather, it allows the innocent party to suspend further performance until he receives adequate assurances that performance will be forthcoming. Therefore, the contract between Sam and Bob is not discharged because of prospective inability of performance.\n\n",

        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Bob can recover from Sam because Sam's statement to Bob that Winnie would not go along with the sale should reasonably be interpreted as a repudiation. Anticipatory repudiation occurs where a promisor, prior to the time set for performance, unequivocally indicates that he cannot or will not perform when the time comes. Anticipatory repudiation gives the nonrepudiator the option of suspending his performance and waiting to sue until the performance date, or to sue immediately. Here, Sam unequivocally stated that he could not deliver the car for $\\$ 25,000$ because of Winnie's refusal to convey her interest. This repudiation excused Bob's tender on the date set for delivery, and gave rise to an immediate action for damages. (A) is incorrect because Bob's duty to tender $\\$ 25,000$ on the date set for delivery was excused by Sam's repudiation. As discussed above, Sam's statement that Winnie would not agree to a $\\$ 25,000$ sale was an anticipatory breach. Therefore, Bob's duty to tender the $\\$ 25,000$ was excused, leaving Sam without a cause of action for breach. (C) is incorrect because Sam's repudiation the day after the contract was signed gave rise to an immediate action for damages. As discussed above, Sam's statement about Winnie's refusal to sell for under $\\$ 40,000$ was an anticipatory repudiation. This repudiation excused Bob's duty to tender the $\\$ 25,000$ and gave him the right to immediate recovery from Sam for breach of contract. (D) is incorrect because the contract was not terminated. As discussed above, Sam's statement about Winnie's unwillingness to sell the car for $\\$ 25,000$ was an anticipatory breach. This repudiation excused Bob's duty to tender the $\\$ 25,000$ and gave rise to an immediate action for damages.

        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Quack will be able to recover a reasonable price for his services. While the parties failed to agree on a material term, most courts today will imply reasonable terms if they are consistent with the parties' intent as otherwise expressed. Terms that can be supplied by a reasonableness standard include a price term for the performance of services. Unless the parties have shown at the time of contracting that they do not want a contract until they agree on a price, a reasonable price will be implied.

(C) is wrong because it fails to take into account that a court will imply a reasonable price term. (D) is wrong because it is irrelevant.

Wes paid $\\$ 100,000$ down and agreed to pay the balance in equal monthly installments over the next 15 years.\n\nJane's eldest son, Luke, started law school in 1999 and, because Jane wanted to help him with his educational and living expenses, she sent a letter to Wes instructing him to send Luke $\\$ 500$ a month from the money he owed to Jane until Jane instructed him otherwise.\n\nWes was unable to raise the capital he needed to expand the hotel, and in 2000 he sold the resort to Funco in exchange for Funco's agreement to assume all his obligations and to provide him with a long-term contract to be the hotel's manager. Funco agreed with these terms and assumed the contract Wes had with Jane.\n\nIn 2002, when Luke had completed law school, Jane's other son, Zack, was getting married. Jane knew Zack could not afford to buy a house so Jane told Zack that she would instruct Wes and Funco to send the full installments to Zack so he could buy a house if Zack agreed that Jane could have the funds back if she ever needed them. Zack agreed, and Jane wrote a letter to Wes informing him of this agreement and instructing him that the full payment should now go to Zack. Zack was given a copy of this letter.\n\nIn 2003, Funco wanted to get out of the resort business, and it sold the hotel and all the obligations back to Wes. About this same time, Jane promised her sister's daughter, Susan, that if she wanted to go to Europe for several months to study art, Jane would pay her expenses.

        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Wes will prevail because Luke was a gratuitous assignee of the contract between Wes and Jane, and Jane had expressly reserved the right to stop the payments at any time, which she did by making a subsequent assignment of the right to Zack. (A) is wrong because Luke had rights under the contract that he could enforce against Wes until Jane revoked the assignment. (B) is wrong because the facts do not show a change in position in reliance upon Jane's actions. (D) is wrong because Luke's right to receive the funds was limited to the period in which Jane told Wes to send the funds.\n\n",

Zack's initial interest in the proceeds was subject to Jane's right to revoke by a subsequent assignment, which Zack had acknowledged. During the time Funco sold back the hotel and obligations to Wes, the proceeds were assigned to Susan; therefore, Zack's rights were not vested. (A) and (B) are wrong because there was no vesting when Funco was an obligor. Zack was not a third-party beneficiary of the original agreement between Jane and Wes; he was a subsequent assignee of Jane's rights. While he may have been a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between Wes and Funco, he did not assent to it or change his position in reliance on it; hence, his rights did not vest. (D) is wrong because the contract between Funco and Wes expressly required Funco to assume Wes's obligations.

Parker decided to hurry home. He called the airport and reserved space on the next flight out, scheduled to leave at $6: 15$ a.m. Parker packed and rushed to the lobby. However, it happened that a number of guests were checking out early that morning, and thus there was a long line ahead of him and only one cashier on duty. Parker hoped that the line would move quickly, but when he heard the first guest in line arguing with Stockton, the desk clerk, over a $25 \\notin$ telephone charge, he realized that he would never make it to the airport in time if he continued to wait in line. The hotel had no express check-out service available, so he left without paying his bill and flew home.\n\nAs soon as Parker's child was out of danger, he wrote a letter to Hotel, apologizing for his swift departure and enclosing payment for two nights' lodging; he also added an extra $\\$ 25$ \"to cover any inconvenience and billing expense\" he may have caused.

While Pitts was driving home from the dealership, she stopped at a red light. She was struck from behind by a truck driven by Drago, who had negligently failed to stop. On impact, the door on the driver's side of the car flew open because of a defective latch. Pitts fell out the open door and was injured. Pitts fell even though she was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the impact because the seatbelt buckle was also defective and failed to hold Pitts.

        "Final Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Although the language in Maude's will uses the word \"jointly,\" the grant also states \"as tenants in common.\" Since no right of survivorship is mentioned, the court will most likely find that this language establishes a tenancy in common, rather than a joint tenancy. Lisa can pass her interest in the property by will, and thus Estelle now holds the property as a tenant in common with Louis. (A) is wrong; Louis's management of the use of the farm does not entitle him to an exclusive interest in it. (B) is wrong because the interest created by Maude's will was a tenancy in common, not a joint tenancy. (C) is wrong because the unities only apply to a joint tenancy.\n\n",

However, after Maude's death, Louis had second thoughts about living on the farm. His children were becoming disciplinary problems in school, and remembering some of his strict but kindly teachers in the Rural County schools, he decided to move back to the farm. Thus, Louis and his family moved into Maude's home. Louis rented various parts of the land to sharecroppers.

The total contract price was $\\$ 500,000$. The lot on which the residence was to be built was located on the seashore in Palm Beach, Florida and there was an existing woodframe structure that had to be demolished before the residence could be built. Owner contracted with Designer to furnish the interior of the residence after Builder completed construction, but no date was included in either contract for completion of the home.

When Harry stopped his car and Christine ran to the van, she discovered to her horror that her father was dead. Zelda appeared to be injured, but not severely. Because her father previously had heart trouble, Christine assumed that he had had a heart attack while driving, although a later investigation would reveal that the accident was caused solely by a defect in the steering mechanism of the van. Filled with remorse, Christine told Zelda, \"I'm so sorry about this.

(B) is incorrect because a court will not examine the promisor's subjective intent when making a promise.

        "Explanation": "(A)  Christine offered to pay Dr. Winston if Dr. Winston treated Zelda. Dr. Winston accepted by treating Zelda; this treatment was also her consideration for the contract.

The requirement of a writing under the Statute of Frauds for promises to pay the debt of another is not applicable here. Christine's promise was not a suretyship promise that was collateral to a promise of Zelda's; it was an independent promise by Christine to be primarily liable for Zelda's medical expenses, and therefore need not be in writing to be enforceable. (C) is incorrect because Dr. Winston's treatment is the consideration for Christine's promise to pay. There is nothing in the facts to suggest that Dr. Winston had incurred a preexisting duty to treat Zelda until she recovered; even if Dr. Winston had already agreed to begin treating Zelda, Dr. Winston received Christine's letter and then proceeded to treat Zelda until she recovered, sending Christine the bill in reliance on her promise. Hence, a court will find sufficient consideration here to avoid a preexisting duty problem. (D) is incorrect because Dr. Winston's treatment was the benefit that Christine sought to derive from her bargain. Remember that the benefit need not have economic value.

Wyoming state law grants each county great autonomy in setting the health standards governing the preparation, packaging, transportation, and sale of foodstuffs. The Pecos County council recently enacted an ordinance, valid under the constitution and statutes of Wyoming, prohibiting the packaging and sale of any food item in any nonbiodegradable material; the ordinance defines nonbiodegradable and specifically lists as prohibited all forms of plastics, cellophane, or similar materials. The ordinance specifically exempts from its terms sales of food to public institutions such as hospitals, jails, and schools.\n\nSnak-Mart, a retail food seller in East Rabbit's Foot, files an appropriate court action attacking the Pecos County ordinance on the grounds that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court should rule:\n\n(A) For Snak-Mart, because the state's interests could be effectuated by alternative methods less intrusive upon Snak-Mart's constitutional rights.\n\n(B) For Snak-Mart, because no compelling state interest is served by the challenged ordinance.\n\n(C) For Pecos County, because the state may regulate in this area as Congress has not entered the field.\n\n(D) For Pecos County, because the ordinance is rationally related to a legitimate state interest-the health and safety of its citizens. \n\n\\section{Questions 147-148} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nOn January 1, Fred executed and delivered a deed to his daughter, Diane, conveying his avocado ranch as follows: \"To Diane for life, but if Diane dies survived by her spouse and children, then to Diane's spouse for life, with the remainder in fee simple to Diane's children; but if Diane dies survived by her spouse and no children, then to my son Sam in fee simple.\"\n\nOn June 15, Diane married George and as a wedding gift Fred quitclaimed his interest in the avocado ranch to George. Assume that the jurisdiction does not follow the doctrine of destructibility of contingent remainders.\n\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Pedestrian had fallen and was in \"helpless peril\" when Driver's car struck him. If Driver had the \"last clear chance\" to avoid the accident, that would override any contributory negligence on Pedestrian's part. (A) is incorrect because \"danger invites rescue,\" and it is foreseeable that an adult would rush out to aid a child in danger. (B) is incorrect because one may be negligent even if speed limits are observed. (C) is incorrect because relatives are not the only people who may be expected to be rescuers, even though Pedestrian did not have a duty to rescue Child.\n\n",

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nDriver knew that children frequently played in the street along Elm Street. As Driver was operating his vehicle along Elm Street, he saw a ball roll into the street. A few seconds later, Child darted out into the street after the ball. Pedestrian, a passerby, saw Driver's vehicle bearing down on Child. Concerned that Child would be hurt, Pedestrian rushed into the street to try to save Child. Just as Pedestrian reached Child, Pedestrian tripped and fell down in the street. Driver's car struck both Pedestrian and Child, and both were injured. The jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules. 143. Assuming that Child is four years old, will Child prevail in a personal injury suit against Driver?\n(A) Yes, because Driver knew that chil- dren played in Elm Street.\n(B) Yes, unless Driver was going no faster than the posted speed limit.\n(C) No, because Child negligently darted into the street.\n(D) No, because Child's parents were negligent in not properly supervising Child.\n\n\n On December 1, Diane died without children and without a will. The applicable law of intestate succession provides that George is Diane's only heir. Sam claims that George has no interest in the land. Title to the avocado ranch is held by whom?\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  George, because of the doctrine of merger.\n\n(B) George, because Diane died intestate and her fee simple passed to him as her intestate heir.\n\n(C) Sam, because the interest granted to Diane's spouse is void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.\n\n(D) Sam, because Diane, although survived by her spouse, died without children.\n\n\n\\section{148} Assume for the purposes of this question only that Diane died survived by George and two children, Ann and Bradley. Bradley dies intestate two days after Diane, leaving one child, Curtis, as his only heir. What are the respective interests of George, Ann, and Curtis in the avocado ranch?\n\n(A) George has a life estate, Ann has an absolutely vested remainder, and Curtis has nothing. (B) George has fee simple ownership of the ranch, and Ann and Curtis have nothing.\n\n(C) George has a life estate, and Ann and Curtis have absolutely vested remainders.\n\n(D) George has a life estate, and Ann has a vested remainder subject to open.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "(A)  The ranch will pass exactly as expressed by Fred in the deed. Since Diane died without children, George does not have a life estate. (A) is wrong because, absent applicability of the doctrine of destructibility of contingent remainders, merger occurs when a life estate and a vested remainder or reversion is held by the same person-not the case here because George has no life estate. Diane's interest is a life estate; thus, she has no interest to pass to George by intestate succession. (B) is therefore wrong. (C) is wrong because the Rule Against Perpetuities is not violated; the spouse's interest will vest, if at all, within a life in being plus 21 years, since Diane's spouse will be identifiable at her death.\n\n",

In the circumstances of the problem, Jesse could argue with some force that he did not intend to kill the MP or act with premeditation, but must account for the fact that the killing occurred in what could be characterized as a burglary, which would be murder under the statutes of the jurisdiction. Thus, if Jesse did not have the requisite intent, he did not commit burglary and so the killing does not fall under the felony murder part of the statute. Jesse can therefore be convicted only if he acted intentionally or with premeditation. (A) is incorrect because voluntary intoxication is not a defense unless it negates intent; (A) concerns the issue of causation. (B) is wrong because it states the wrong standard of proof-the prosecution must prove all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. $(\\mathrm{C})$ is wrong because voluntary intoxication may be a defense to the felony murder definition of murder.\n\n",

Betty and her teenage son, Norm, planned to live in the house for this period. Norm was a star baseball player for the local high school team. To provide Norm with an adequate place to practice, Betty installed a fully operational batting cage in the backyard located on Red Acre.

Six months after Alice leased the premises to Betty, Alice mortgaged Red Acre to State Bank to secure a loan. Betty was not notified directly of the mortgage but the mortgage was recorded. Six months before the three-year term was to end, Alice defaulted on her mortgage payments, and State Bank began foreclosure proceedings, as it was entitled to do on the terms of the mortgage. Although unaware of the mortgage proceedings, Betty knew that her lease with Alice was about to end; she therefore began to remove all of the equipment she had installed in the backyard.

        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Yes, because Baker's fax ordering the computers was an acceptance of Stevens's offer.\n\n(B) Yes, because Stevens's fax was an acceptance of the offer in Baker's first fax.\n\n(C) No, because the fax sent by Baker was an offer that was never accepted by Stevens.\n\n(D) No, because none of the communications were worded in such a way as to be definite and certain enough to be offers.\n\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  Stevens's fax will be considered an offer and Baker's second fax will be considered an acceptance of the offer. Although Baker merely asked for a price quote, Stevens's fax in response will be construed as an offer because the language and surrounding circumstances make it reasonable for Baker to expect that Stevens was willing to enter into a contract. \"I can deliver 20 computers ... [for] \\$2,000 per computer\" coupled with the fact that Stevens knew that Baker wanted to buy 20 computers makes it reasonable for Baker to assume that Stevens was manifesting a promise, undertaking, or commitment to enter into a contract, especially since the terms were so specific here as to quantity, price, and delivery date. Baker's response was an acceptance of Stevens's offer to sell the computers. (B) is wrong because Stevens's fax was the offer, not the acceptance. Baker's initial fax could not be construed as an offer because it did not manifest present contractual intent and was not definite as to the terms. Therefore, (C) is also wrong. (D) is wrong because Stevens's fax was definite enough to be an offer. The U.C.C. does not require the same degree of formality as the common law, and so a contract was clearly formed when Baker responded with the fax.\n\n",

Baker called his normal supplier of computers but was informed that the supplier was out of computers. Baker immediately sent a fax to Stevens explaining the situation and asking for \"a price quote for 20 computers to be delivered before the first of next month.\" Stevens responded by fax: \"I can deliver 20 computers from my present stock at a cost of $\\$ 2,000$ per computer.\" Baker responded the next day with a fax that stated: \"I will buy 20 computers at a cost of $\\$ 2,000$ per computer.\"\n\n\n Assume for the purpose of this question only that a contract exists between the parties for the sale of the 20 computers.

City defaults on its payments to Baker. Is Baker liable for the last payment of $\\$ 10,000$ to Stevens?\n\n",
        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Yes, because the provisions only set a reasonable time for payment.\n\n(B) Yes, because a buyer may not delegate the duty of payment.\n\n(C) No, because an express condition for payment to Stevens has not occurred.\n\n(D) No, because Baker has not received sufficient funds to make the payment to Stevens.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "(A)  The fact that Baker was to pay the $\\$ 10,000$ when he received his last payment from City would be interpreted as a provision setting the time for payment rather than the source from which the payment was to come, because the price was clearly set at $\\$ 40,000$ and was not expressly made conditional on City's paying Baker.

If a criminal law or regulation fails to give persons reasonable notice of what is prohibited, it may violate the Due Process Clause. This principle is applied somewhat strictly when First Amendment activity is involved in order to avoid the chilling effect a vague law might have on speech (i.e., if it is unclear what speech is regulated, people might refrain from speech that is permissible for fear that they will be violating the law). Here, the statute does not give reasonable notice as to what language is being prohibited, and no court decisions have limited its construction. Thus, it is impermissibly vague, and Smith will prevail. Therefore, (A) incorrectly states that Smith will not prevail. (B) is incorrect because it is too broad a statement. First Amendment freedoms are not absolute; for instance, obscenity may be punished under a properly drawn statute. The problem here is that it cannot be determined what speech is being prohibited.

        "Explanation": " The court should not hear this suit on the merits because Article III courts are not empowered to hear suits between citizens of the same state where no federal question jurisdiction is involved. Article III lists the cases to which federal jurisdiction extends. It includes suits arising under federal law, and suits between citizens of two or more states. Zall's suit against Motors involves two citizens of the state of Paxico and no federal question is raised. No provision of Article III covers such a suit. Thus, Zall should have brought suit in Paxico state court. (A) is incorrect because the Contracts Clause deals with state legislation impairing contracts and no such legislation is implied by the facts. Article III has no general provision for suits involving the obligation of contracts. (B) is incorrect because while it might be said that the action can affect interstate commerce and thus is subject to federal regulation, absent such federal regulation, there is no basis under Article III for jurisdiction. Article III does not provide for federal court jurisdiction in all cases affecting interstate commerce. (D) is incorrect because a \"case or controversy\" exists.

While the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment only applies to state action, it is clear that arbitrary or invidious discrimination by the federal government violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

(B) is wrong because, where a public employee holds his position at the will of an employer, there is no property interest in continued employment.

(C) is incorrect because the statute does not treat state residents differently from out-of-state residents. (D) is nonsensical. Note: Under the Supreme Court's decisions regarding the sale of contraceptives to minors, the best possible answer would have been that the statute violated equal protection because it denied a fundamental right to a class of persons (minors) without sufficient justification.

However, the government can limit the class of persons who are allowed to vote in an election of persons to serve on a special purpose government unit if the unit has a special impact on the class of enfranchised voters. The watershed improvement districts referred to in this question are so specialized that election of their directors is not subject to the \"one person, one vote\" principle.

        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": " Race is a suspect classification under the Equal Protection Clause. However, the Fourteenth Amendment only applies if there is action by a state or local government office, or a private individual whose behavior meets the requirement of \"state action.\" State action exists where seemingly private individuals (i) perform exclusive public functions, or (ii) have significant state involvement in their activities. \"State action\" also exists where a state affirmatively facilitates, encourages, or authorizes acts of discrimination by its citizens. However, there must be some sort of affirmative act by the state approving the private action. It is not enough that the state merely permits the conduct to occur. Under these facts, several state officials serve on the Bar Association's Board of Bar Governors. Furthermore, the state supreme court requires all lawyers to be members of the State Bar Association. Thus, the State Bar Association does not operate independently of the state and, therefore, Plaintiffs' strongest argument would be to demonstrate that \"state action\" is involved in payment of dues by the Association to private clubs that discriminate. Thus, (C) is correct. (A) is wrong because \"state action\" is required to invoke the antidiscrimination protections of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(B) is wrong because the failure of the Association to pass a resolution forbidding discrimination does not, in and of itself, constitute a denial of equal protection, and the argument for state action being present is much weaker than in option (C). (D) is wrong because, unless it is shown that the Association is an instrumentality of the state or closely intertwined with state action, the mere fact of its payment of dues to such private clubs will not invoke the Equal Protection Clause.

Although theoretically the seller of land will be fully compensated by money damages, the courts will usually grant specific performance to the seller, because land is considered unique. Thus, (A) is incorrect. Although Bard did not have title to Broadacres at the time he entered into the option contract with Cutter, he did own the option to buy the property. By exercising his option under his agreement with Osif, Bard could have obtained title to Broadacres. This, in turn, would have enabled Bard to convey to Cutter, if the latter exercised his option. Thus, Bard could have been compelled to perform. Because Bard is able to perform, and Cutter has exercised his option for purchase of the land, the case is an appropriate one for specific performance. Only (B) reaches this conclusion. \n\n",

The lease contained the following provision: \"No subleasing or assignment will be permitted unless with the written consent of the lessor.\" One year later, Brenda assigned all interest in the lease to Carolyn, who assumed and agreed to perform the lessee's obligations under the terms of the lease. Ann learned of the assignment and wrote to Brenda that she had no objection to the assignment to Carolyn and agreed to accept rent from Carolyn instead of Brenda. Thereafter, Carolyn paid rent to Ann for a period of five years. Carolyn then defaulted and went into bankruptcy. In an appropriate action, Ann sued Brenda for rent due.

        "Final Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": " If Ann loses it will be because there was a novation. A novation occurs when a new contract substitutes a new party to receive benefits and assume duties that had belonged to one of the original parties under the terms of an old contract. All the parties must agree to the substitution. A novation discharges the old contract. The elements of a valid novation are: (i) a previous valid contract; (ii) an agreement among all parties, including the new party to the new contract; (iii) the immediate extinguishment of contractual duties as between the original parties; and (iv) a valid and enforceable new contract. When lessor Ann wrote to Carolyn agreeing to accept rent and Carolyn began to do so, a new contract was formed, and Ann's rights against Brenda were extinguished. (A) is incorrect because laches is not available here. Laches is an equitable defense available when a party delays in bringing an equitable suit and the delay prejudices the defendant. The action here (for back rent) is at law, not equity. Moreover, nothing in the facts indicates that Ann delayed in bringing her action. Thus, laches is not available. (B) is incorrect because there was no accord and satisfaction. An accord occurs when the parties to a contract agree to substitute a different duty for an existing duty under the contract. Satisfaction occurs when the new duty is performed. There was no new duty here; rather, the parties agreed to substitute a new party under an existing contract (a novation). (D) is incorrect because attornment arises when the tenant agrees to accept a new landlord, and here Ann remained the landlord at all times.\n\n",

        "Final Answer": "C",

Thus, Boone (the obligee) would be required to accept performance by the delegate (Coot). Therefore, (B), which states that Boone may refuse to accept such performance, is incorrect. Because the contract does not prohibit Addie's assignment thereof, (A) incorrectly states that such assignment renders Addie in breach.

        "Final Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": " Generally, offers are revocable unless the offeror receives consideration to keep the offer open. If a merchant signs a written offer giving assurances that it will be held open, the offer is irrevocable for the stated period or for a reasonable time if no period is stated. Here, the language at issue would probably be interpreted as a promise not to revoke; however, the offeror (Duffer) is not a merchant (i.e., he does not deal in goods of the kind being sold). Thus, in the absence of consideration being given for this promise, it remains revocable. (A) is incorrect because, although there is a sale of goods, neither of the parties is a merchant, and hence, the \"firm offer\" provision of the U.C.C. does not apply. (B) makes no sense because the very terms of the offer state that Slicker can accept prior to noon on November 12.

Neese did not learn of the agreement until her birthday on May 5. Before they signed the writing, Artisan and Ohner had orally agreed that their \"written agreement will be null and void unless Ohner is able to obtain a $\\$ 5,000$ loan from the First National Bank before January 31.\"\n\n\n For this question only, assume that Ohner obtained the loan, that Artisan completed the remodeling on May 1, and that on May 3 , at Artisan's request, Ohner paid the $\\$ 5,000$ to Artisan.

Here, force was threatened, not actually used. Had the teller felt any apprehension that Jack would use a gun if he did not do what he was told, this would be \"fear\" even though the victim remained cool and poised while complying with the demands, and knew that as long as he did so, no force would be used.

        "Explanation": " Battery is an unlawful application of force to the person of another resulting in bodily injury or an offensive touching. Adam's shooting and wounding of Mitchell meets all the elements of the crime. Thus, Adam is guilty of battery. Bailey is also guilty of battery because Adam conspired with Bailey to operate an illegal still, and each co-conspirator is liable for the crimes of all other co-conspirators if: (i) the crimes were committed in furtherance of the objective of the conspiracy; and (ii) the crimes were a natural and probable consequence of the conspiracy (i.e., foreseeable).

(A) is incorrect because a finding that Dent acted recklessly would not necessarily suffice to reduce the crime to voluntary manslaughter. Provocation is the key. (C) is incorrect because to the extent that Dent intended to kill or to cause serious bodily harm, he was acting in the wake of a sudden and intense passion that caused him to lose his self-control, which would make voluntary manslaughter applicable.

        "Problem Statement": "\n\nBrown suffered from the delusion that he was a special agent of God. He frequently experienced hallucinations in the form of hearing divine commands. Brown believed God told him several times that the local Roman Catholic bishop was corrupting the diocese into heresy, and that the bishop should be \"done away with.\" Brown, a devout Catholic, conceived of himself as a religious martyr. He knew that shooting bishops for heresy is against the criminal law. $\\mathrm{He}$ nevertheless carefully planned how he might kill the bishop. One evening Brown shot the bishop, who was taken to the hospital, where he died two weeks later.\n\nBrown told the police he assumed the institutions of society would support the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and he expected to be persecuted for his God-inspired actions. Psychiatrist Stevens examined Brown and found that Brown suffered from schizophrenic psychosis, that in the absence of this psychosis he would not have shot the bishop, and that because of the psychosis Brown found it extremely difficult to determine whether he should obey the specific command that he do away with the bishop or the general commandment \"Thou shalt not kill\"; Brown was charged with murder.

(B) is the best answer here, because this option goes directly to the wrongfulness issue and is supported by the facts, which indicate Brown's moral dilemma. His conclusion that direct orders from God overrode the general prohibition against killing indicates that Brown did not know the wrongfulness of his act. (A) and (C) are incorrect because the M'Naghten test speaks of nature and quality, and each of these options contains only one of these two elements. In addition, the facts are less likely to support an assertion that Brown was ignorant of either the nature or quality of his act than that he did not understand it was wrong. (D) is wrong because mental disease is but one element of the M'Naghten test.

We robbed the place-what else is there to say?\" Sam said nothing. Sam was escorted into another room and a full written confession was then obtained from Alex.\n\nIf Sam is brought to trial on an indictment charging him with robbery, the fact that Sam failed to object to Alex's statement and remained silent after Alex had implicated him in the crime should be ruled:\n\n",

Here, the affidavit is an out-of-court statement Plaintiff seeks to introduce to prove that Joe was incompetent when he conveyed the property. Hence, it is hearsay. The affidavit does not fall within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule. Hence, (B) is correct. (A) is wrong because opinion testimony by lay witnesses is admissible when: (i) it is rationally based on the perception of the witness; and (ii) it is helpful to a clear understanding of testimony or to the determination of a fact in issue. Opinions of laypersons as to the general appearance or condition of a person are generally admissible. The problem here does not involve \"opinion,\" but rather the fact that the affidavit is hearsay. (C) is wrong because the affidavit does not qualify as an official document. The official records exception to the hearsay rule covers records, reports, statements, or data compilations of public offices and agencies made by, and within the scope of duty of, the public employee. Harry and his affidavit have no such official standing. (D) is wrong because the affidavit is 15 years old, and the Federal Rules of Evidence require that a document be at least 20 years old to qualify as an \"ancient document.\" (It should also be noted that statements affecting an interest in property are not subject to the 20 -year rule.

Evidence of character to prove the conduct of a person in the litigated event is generally not admissible in civil cases, because the slight probative value of character is outweighed by the danger of prejudice, the possible distraction of the jury from the main question in issue, and the possible waste of time required by examination of collateral issues.

Thus, the general rule applies, and (D) is correct. (A) is incorrect because habit describes one's regular response to a specific set of circumstances. Here, however, what is involved is character evidence rather than habit evidence. Character describes one's disposition in respect to general traits (i.e., Dan's reputation in the community as a reckless driver).

However, such evidence may be relevant if it is probative of the material issue involved, and if such probative value outweighs the risk of confusion or unfair prejudice.

(B) is incorrect because the statement against interest exception requires that the declarant be unavailable as a witness. Passenger does not appear to be unavailable. Also, the statement does not seem to be against the interest of Passenger (although it certainly is against the interest of Peters).

        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Any right implied to expand the original use of the right-of-way creates an interest that violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.\n\n(B) The original installation by United Utility defined the scope of the easement.\n\n(C) Oaks did not expressly agree to the location of the right-of-way.\n\n(D) The assertion of the right to install an additional pipeline constitutes inverse condemnation.\n\n",
        "Final Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": " If Oaks prevails, it will be because the original installation defined the scope of the easement. The scope of the easement depends on the intent of the parties. In determining the intent of the parties, the courts look at the subsequent conduct of the parties respecting the arrangement as well as the language of the instrument. Here, the instrument states the location is to be mutually agreed upon. Oaks and United agreed to the original pipeline and its location, but have not agreed upon the location of the second set of pipes. The parties' subsequent conduct could also lead to the conclusion that the first installation was the full extent of what the parties intended. (A) is incorrect because the Rule Against Perpetuities has absolutely no application to these facts. The easement was vested when it was created, and easements are presumed to be perpetual. (C) is incorrect because Oaks will be deemed to have acquiesced in the location of the original easement. (D) is wrong because inverse condemnation is the term for a landowner's lawsuit for damages to recover for a governmental taking without exercising its formal power of eminent domain (e.g., regulatory takings that deprive the owner of all economically viable uses of the property). Even if United were a government agency and this were a regulatory taking, inverse condemnation would not be correct since Oaks is seeking an injunction, not compensation.\n\n",

        "Final Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": " A remainder is a future interest created in a transferee that is capable of becoming a present interest upon the natural termination of the preceding estates created in the same disposition. A contingent remainder is a remainder that is subject to a condition precedent, or a remainder that is created in favor of unborn or unascertained persons. Here, Ana Maria's unborn children will take a remainder, because their interest will become a present interest upon the natural termination of the preceding estate (upon Enrique's death). Because this remainder is created in favor of unborn and unascertained persons, it is contingent. A vested remainder subject to divestment arises when the remainderman is in existence and ascertained and his interest is not subject to any condition precedent, but his right to possession is subject to being defeated by some condition subsequent. (B) is incorrect because the remaindermen are neither in existence nor ascertained. A springing use is a form of executory interest (a future interest in a transferee that is not capable of taking on the natural termination of the preceding estate). (C) is incorrect because Ana Maria's children's interest will become a present interest upon the natural termination of the preceding estate.

        "Final Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": " If Marsh wins, it will be because there was no effective acceptance of delivery of the deed. There must be acceptance by the grantee to complete a conveyance. Although acceptance is presumed, this presumption is rebutted by evidence of rejection. Here, Simon expressly rejected the conveyance, and therefore, title never passed to Simon. (A) is incorrect because a constructive trust presumes that Simon had legal title. As discussed above, title did not pass to Simon. Furthermore, even had title passed, a constructive trust would probably be inappropriate here. Constructive trust is the appropriate remedy for unjust enrichment, and there is no indication of any wrongdoing under these facts. (B) is an incorrect statement of law. If the grantor intends the recording of the deed to be the final act in vesting title in the grantee, such recording creates a presumption of delivery even though the grantee did not know of the recordation. (C) is wrong because there is no such thing as a constructive reconveyance.

        "Answer Choices": "(A)  Jones, because Jones was a thirdparty creditor beneficiary of the contract between Sloan and Abstract Company.\n\n(B) Jones, because the abstract prepared by Abstract Company constitutes a guarantee of Jones's title to Newacre.\n\n(C) Abstract Company, because Abstract Company had no knowledge of the existence of the right-of-way.\n\n(D) Abstract Company, because there was no showing that any fraud was practiced upon Jones.\n\n\n",

Abstract Company is liable because it failed to uncover the existence of the right-of-way deed which was in the chain of title. Jones should recover because he was the intended beneficiary. (B) is wrong because Abstract Company is liable on breach of its contract to describe accurately the state of the record title. It gave no title guarantee. (C) is wrong because, while Abstract Company may have had no actual knowledge of the deed, it had a contractual duty to find any encumbrances in the record chain of title. (D) is wrong because fraud is not necessary for a showing of breach of contract.\n\n",

        "Explanation": " Every land sale contract (not deed) contains an implied warranty of marketable title. For bar examination purposes, title acquired by adverse possession is unmarketable. However, the buyer's acceptance of a deed discharges the seller's contractual obligation to furnish marketable title, and leaves the buyer with remedies only on the covenants in the deed. (D) is wrong because a deed contains no implied covenant of marketability. (A) is wrong because it is not supported by the facts, and (C) is an incorrect statement of law; a buyer can choose to rescind, sue for damages for breach, get specific performance with abatement of the purchase price, or, in some jurisdictions, require the seller to quiet title.\n\n",

        "Final Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": " (D) is the correct answer by a process of elimination. (A) is incorrect because there is no racial discrimination or other constitutionally questionable activity presented in the facts. (B) is wrong because marketable title is title reasonably free from doubt. Generally, this involves either defects in the chain of title or encumbrances that might present an unreasonable risk of litigation. The dues scheme is not such an encumbrance. (C) is incorrect because the scheme does not impose a direct restraint on alienation of the fee. There are no disabling restraints, forfeiture restraints, or promissory restraints on transferability of property. Thus, by a process of elimination, (D) presents the greatest obstacle to establishing the scheme, even though a majority of courts today allow real covenants that require payment of an annual fee for maintenance of common ways, parks, etc.\n\n",

Black, the owner of Meadowview, prepared a development plan creating 200 house lots in Meadowview with the necessary streets and public areas. The plan was fully approved by all necessary governmental agencies and duly recorded. However, construction of the streets, utilities, and other aspects of the development of Meadowview has not yet begun, and none of the streets can be opened as public ways until they are completed in accordance with the applicable ordinances of the municipality in which Meadowview is located.\n\nCollege Avenue, one of the streets laid out as part of the Meadowview development, abuts Whiteacre, an adjacent one-acre parcel owned by White. Whiteacre has no access to any public way except an old, poorly developed road which is inconvenient and cannot be used without great expense. White sold Whiteacre to Breyer. The description used in the deed from White to Breyer was the same as that used in prior deeds except that the portion of the description which formerly said, \"thence by land of Black, northeasterly a distance of 200 feet, more or less,\" was changed to \"thence by College Avenue as laid out on the Plan of Meadowview North $16^{\\circ}$ East $201.6$ feet,\" with full reference to the plan and as recording data.\n\nBreyer now seeks a building permit which will show that Breyer intends to use College Avenue for access to Whiteacre.
