In this thesis we have considered the performance of clustering using both mixture and mixed membership models for multivariate and network data. In Chapter~\ref{chap:BayesLCA}, two applications of latent class analysis were considered; first, the performance of different inference methods were investigated, then a collapsed sampler over the model space was developed. In Chapter~\ref{chap:boards}, the clustering performance of mixture and mixed membership models were compared. After reviewing social networks in Chapter~\ref{chap:litreview}, the MMSB was developed to include actor covariates in Chapter~\ref{chap:mmesb}.

 %\item Prior specification and identifiability issues, particularly for mixed membership models.
In all papers, model choice was a key consideration, and it remains an ongoing challenge for MBC methods, particularly for models with an intractable likelihood. In this context, it can be difficult to use approximations to likelihood based criterion such as AIC and BIC, since it is often difficult to ascertain how accurate the approximations are, if at all. This is particularly true for network models, where even accurate identification of the penalty term of the BIC, in particular, estimating the effective sample size of the data, is in itself a challenge.

Collapsed Gibbs sampler approaches similar to the method proposed in the second paper in Chapter~\ref{chap:BayesLCA} for the SBM~\citep{mcdaid12} and latent position cluster model~\citep{Ryan2013} have proved effective, and may help to shed light on the accuracy of other approaches to model estimation. It remains to be seen whether such methods can prove comparably effective when applied to mixed membership problems; while collapsed sampling approaches to mixed membership models~\citep{Porteous08,lda} are referred to in passing in Chapter~\ref{chap:litreview}, these approaches attempt only to discover areas of high density in the model posterior, and do not attempt to achieve the sustained sampling typically required in the statistical literature. In particular, it may be computationally expensive to undo any label switching which occurs in a chain of reasonable length in this setting.

When faced with choosing a model for mixed membership models, we have taken one of two approaches: estimation of the integrated likelihood via Monte Carlo methods in the papers in Chapter~\ref{chap:boards}, and a cross validation based method in Chapter~\ref{chap:mmesb}. Both methods have their advantages -- the cross validation method is intuitively appealing, and in a network setting provides a more tangible understanding of performance. On the other hand, the integrated likelihood approach may be more useful when identifying smaller groups - since parts of the dataset are not removed during its calculation. This may be a benefit for cases such as in the second paper in Chapter~\ref{chap:boards}, when it is of particular interest to identify small groups of influential users. 

Throughout this thesis, simplifying assumptions have been made in order to facilitate inference. In particular, conditional independence assumptions have been made for the models in Chapters~\ref{chap:BayesLCA},~\ref{chap:boards} and~\ref{chap:litreview}, so that all dependence between observed data variables is assumed to be explained by the latent variables in the model. This may be an unrealistic assumption, particularly for the mixed membership applications described in Chapter~\ref{chap:boards}. The exchangeability assumptions made by such approaches imply a certain symmetry in datasets which may not exist; for example, runners are more likely to drop out of the race later than earlier in the ultra marathon example in the first paper, and, in the second, the unweighted degree statistics are necessarily lower bounds of the weighted degree statistics. This assumption may cause certain models to perform poorly when applying, for example, posterior predictive checks.


The phrase ``All models are wrong, but some are useful'' \citep{Box1979} is well known to statisticians, and is in fact partly quoted by \citet{erosheva04} in their conclusion. Similarly, \citet{blei03b} refers to latent Dirichlet allocation as a ``simple model'', to use for the complex task at hand. We note that from a purely clustering perspective, the method of mapping observations to profiles described in Chapters~\ref{chap:boards} and~\ref{chap:mmesb} proved to be a successful way to identify which mixed membership patterns were most frequently exhibited. If the express goal of the analyst is to use a clustering method as a data analytic tool, then the standard mixed membership approach can prove highly effective. While more sophisticated methods have since been proposed, mainly by relaxing the Dirichlet assumption for the individual weight parameters\citep{blei07}, from a data analytic perspective, the model has proved useful, and in the case of the second paper in Chapter~\ref{chap:boards} useful when an implementation using a standard mixture model approach appeared difficult.
 
In conclusion, several future extensions to the methods described in this thesis may be possible. In Chapter~\ref{chap:mmesb} the MMSB was extended to incorporate covariate attribute data. It may also be of interest to extend the exponential family mixed membership models described in Chapter~\ref{chap:boards} to incorporate covariate data, in effect creating a mixed membership generalised linear regression model, a generalisation (or special case, depending on the perspective) of the class of models referred to as mixtures of generalised linear regression models \citep{Wedel1995,flexmix}. 

Appendix~\ref{appendix}
contains two analyses of network data. The first example contains supplemental material from Chapter~\ref{chap:litreview}, which involves fitting a selection of the models described therein to a larger dataset and examining their performance. The second analysis involves a descriptive analysis of a particularly rich dataset containing multiple valued link types, with covariate actor and link information which can be analysed dynamically. The  analysis of message board data described in the second paper of Chapter~\ref{chap:boards} is another example where it was only possible to analyse a heavily summarised version of the raw data. Currently, such rich datasets are beyond the scope of available MBC methods; future analysis may be possible by incorporating new features into existing models.

% While the some of the outlined extensions might require substantial additional compuatational expense, it is worth noting how \citet{dawid79} describes the application of an EM algorithm for LCA to a dataset of $N=45$ observations and $M=5$ variables as ``a slow but sure way of obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of interest.'' It is to be hoped that once insight into model performance and behaviour is formed, strategies such as subsampling of the data, in tandem with continuing advances in computational power, may make such concerns appear similarly quaint.
