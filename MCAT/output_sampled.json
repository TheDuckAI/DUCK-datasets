Nuclear stress testing is often used to determine the extent of coronary artery blockage and assess the damage of heart muscle that arises as a result of a heart attack. In a typical nuclear stress test, the patient first walks on a treadmill to elevate the heart rate. Several minutes into the exercising period, a radiotracer, or a drug tagged with a radioactive element known to target the heart, is injected into the patient's vein and allowed to circulate.

Rarely, GBS can cause permanent paralysis and respiratory failure.\n\nDuring GBS, the immune system produces antibodies to the surface antigens of peripheral myelin. These antibodies facilitate the destruction of the myelin, which leads to the neurological symptoms. Although GBS does not have a treatment, procedures such as plasmapheresis, also known as plasma exchange, can be used to alleviate the symptoms of GBS. During plasmapheresis, the blood is removed from the body and separated into cells and plasma. The plasma is discarded so that only the blood cells are returned to the body in donated or synthetic plasma. Another treatment option is the intravenous delivery of immunoglobulin. The antibodies present in the immunoglobulin may block the antibodies produced to the surface antigens of peripheral myelin. Typically, the symptoms of GBS subside within months of their onset when treatments such as plasmapheresis or immunoglobulin are used.\n43. Based on the information provided in the passage, GBS could BEST be described as:\nA. a dominant genetic disorder\nB. a sex-linked genetic disorder\nC. an autoimmune disorder\nD. an infectious disease",

The passage described Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) as a disorder with unknown causes that leads to the production of antibodies from the immune system that attack the peripheral myelin. Because no pattern of inheritance was stated and the disease is unpredictable in terms of who it strikes, there would be no reason to think this is a genetic condition. This allows choices $A$ and $B$ to be eliminated. The passage mentions that GBS can follow an infection in some but not all cases. No other evidence was provided to suggest that GBS is an infection. This leaves choice $\\mathrm{C}$ as the best answer. Autoimmune diseases are characterized by an immune response to self-structures. Because the immune system is producing antibodies against the peripheral myelin, this would count as an autoimmune condition.",

While normal culturing methods cannot detect these VBNC cells, there are a variety of molecular assays that can be used to indicate metabolic activity in the cells. Additionally, these cells can be resuscitated from VBNC states to a culturable state under appropriate conditions. The VBNC state has been observed in numerous species of bacteria and most recently in yeasts.\n\nEscherichia coli is one of many species of bacteria that are able to enter and resuscitate from VBNC states. Certain strains of $E$. coli cause a variety of infections in humans. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are frequently caused by $E$. coli that exist as harmless residents in the intestinal tract. These infections can be treated using antibiotics to kill the E. coli. However, about 30 percent of women treated for UTIs end up with a recurrence. For those who support the VBNC theory, it has been hypothesized that recurrent UTIs are caused by VBNC E. coli that resuscitate to initiate a new infection. These VBNC cells may not be killed using antibiotic therapies normally used to treat UTIs. Only culturable cells cause the symptoms of a UTI.\n\nThe following graph shows the number of E. coli bacteria present in a patient following antibiotic therapy for a UTI. Day 1 indicates the number of bacteria present at diagnosis. A urine sample was collected each day and cultured for the presence of E. coli as measured in colony-forming units per milliliter of urine (cfu/ml). An assay was also used to determine the number of metabolically active cells that were potentially alive but not culturable (VBNC). The data are as follows:\n\n43.

The goal of creating GM foods is to modify the organisms to express new and useful traits. A few examples involve engineering crops to be resistant to bacterial or viral infections, to be resistant to herbicides, to ripen more slowly, to survive extreme temperature changes, to contain vaccines, or to create crops that are more nutritious.\n\nOne GM food that has received media attention over the years is golden rice. This GM product was first introduced in 2000 and was engineered to provide carotene that is a precursor to vitamin $\\mathrm{A}$. The carotene in the rice provides the golden color. Vitamin A deficiency is a major problem in underdeveloped parts of the world, killing more than one million people a year, most of whom are children. This vitamin is critical for the development and maintenance of epithelial tissues, for vision, and for growth.\n\nRice plants normally produce carotene in the inedible parts of the plant. To be able to access and use the carotene, it was necessary to engineer the rice to produce it in the edible grains. In order to achieve this goal, two genes from daffodil plants, psy and $l y c$, and a bacterial gene called $c r t 1$ were added to the rice genome. These genes engineered a pathway that produces lycopene, which is eventually converted to carotene. Each of these genes was placed under the control of a grain-specific promoter so that the products were produced in the rice grains.\n\nWhile golden rice was produced to provide carotene, which the human body can convert into the essential vitamin A, the rice provided much less carotene than was anticipated. Golden rice 2, a modified version released in 2005, contains a much larger amount of carotene and, as such, is a better source of the vitamin. Field tests were conducted in 2009, and human consumption trials were completed in 2012. However, neither version has been grown in large-scale quantities at this time.\n43.

It is produced by vascular endothelium, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle cells. Because the half-life of NO is only a few seconds, its effects are short lived, but it is nevertheless essential to many of the body's regulation processes. A few of the known roles of NO include control over blood vessel dilation and pressure, involvement in inflammation, neurotransmission, and the regulation of apoptosis (programmed cell death). It is suspected that NO has many other roles in the body that are yet to be completely understood.\n\nNO is produced in cells when a group of enzymes known as nitric oxide synthases (NOS) convert the amino acid L-arginine to L-citrulline. NO is produced as a by-product of the reaction. The activity of NO is modulated by cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP). When present, cGMP increases the vasodilating abilities of NO. The expression of phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes causes the degradation of cGMP that suppresses the function of NO.\n\nBecause NO acts as a smooth muscle vasodilator, a variety of pharmaceuticals that act on NO have been developed. Nitroglycerin, which decreases the amount of oxygen flowing to the myocardium of the heart, is often used to manage the chest pain of angina that is associated with coronary artery disease. Drugs for erectile dysfunction (ED) such as Viagra, Cialis, and Levitra all work by enhancing NO function and increasing vasodilation and blood flow in the penis during sexual stimulation. Even the nutritional supplement industry has tried to manipulate the effects of NO. Bodybuilders and athletes have been using what are termed NO hemodilators, alleging that these supplements increase blood flow to muscles, making them look larger and recover faster after injury.\n13.

Something antagonistic to L-arginine would mean that less would be available to convert to L-citrulline and NO. Decreasing NOS activity would decrease NO. The passage explains that cGMP is needed to modulate the activity of NO. Decreasing cGMP would decrease NO activity. The PDE enzyme degrades cGMP, which in turn decreases NO activity.

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 1-6 are based on the following passage.\n\nPassage I\n\nLeukemia is a term that describes a wide variety of blood cell cancers. Most leukemia cases involve elevated leukocyte counts. In acute cases of leukemia, immature leukocytes proliferate quickly, which leads to many abnormal immature cells in the bone marrow. This inhibits the ability of the bone marrow to produce healthy new leukocytes. This form of the cancer progresses rapidly, and the cells metastasize easily as they move into the bloodstream from the bone marrow. It can be fatal within weeks or months if not treated promptly. In contrast, chronic cases of leukemia typically involve the proliferation of abnormal mature leukocytes. This form of the disease progresses more slowly, and treatment need not always be immediate.\n\nOnce classified as acute or chronic, leukemia can be further subdivided into lymphocytic or myelogenous. This distinction depends on which type of leukocyte is abnormal in the patient. In lymphocytic leukemia, the lymphoid cells, such as the lymphocytes, are abnormal. In the myelogenous form, the myeloid cells, such as basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils, are affected.\n\nChemotherapy drugs are often used in the management of leukemia cases. There are numerous categories of these drugs, and they have varied mechanisms of action. In treatment, several drugs are used in combination because some of the drugs are cell-cycle specific while others are not. Alkylating agents are capable of disrupting the function of DNA. Tubulin-binding agents are designed to interfere with microtubule formation. Other drugs are designed to interfere with DNA polymerase, DNA repair mechanisms, or protein synthesis, or to act as purine analogs. Many of these drugs cannot enter into the brain when injected or ingested, so if the cancer has spread to\n\nthis area, special methods must be used to introduce the drugs to the brain.\n4. Many leukemia patients require antibiotic treatments frequently. Why would this be the case?\n\nA. Some antibiotics are known to be toxic to certain types of cancer cells and may help to damage the cancerous cells.\n\nB. The antibiotics might help to increase the function of the patient's immune system.\n\nC. The antibiotics can help prevent bacterial infections in the patient whose leukocyte function is compromised by the cancer.\n\nD. The antibiotics can help prevent viral infections in the patient.",

The infection is quite common after surgeries when soft tissues become infected and the infection moves to the adjacent bones. The long bones of children are particularly susceptible as they have excellent circulation to them during the growth period. In adults, the best circulation is to the vertebrae, and these are the bones that are most likely to develop osteomyelitis.\n\nOsteomyelitis is treated with various antibiotics, but some patients have chronic infections that are not eradicated by antibiotic therapy due to a unique feature of S. aureus. S. aureus can be internalized by osteoblasts where the bacteria can continue to survive in the intracellular environment. Inside the osteoblasts, bacteria can induce apoptosis, killing their host cell. Surgical debridement is often required to remove the damaged and dead bone tissue created by the infection.\n\nA major research question deals with how an S. aureus infection induces apoptosis in the host osteoblasts. In order for apoptosis to initiate in osteoblasts, the enzyme capsase-8 must be activated. This enzyme serves as a protease that cleaves critical proteins in the cell, causing cell death. Capsase-8 is only expressed under certain circumstances. In the case of osteomyelitis, the S. aureus bacteria cause the induction of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in the osteoblasts. Then TRAIL activates capsase-8, which triggers a series of events leading to apoptosis and death of osteoblasts.\n24. Osteoblasts are normally involved in building new bone matrix.

In addition to the CD4 receptor, there are a variety of coreceptors that are also needed for certain strains of HIV to infect cells. One of these coreceptors is called CCR5 and is needed for the most common strains of HIV (called R5) to infect their host cells. The more CCR5 receptors a cell has, the greater the rate of infection for the cell. Some individuals have the delta-32 allele of CCR5 that leads to a decreased risk of HIV infection.\n\nWomen are at a much higher risk for contracting HIV from a male partner than a male is for contracting HIV from a female partner. Some of the increased risk for women is dependent on sex hormones. It has been hypothesized that women have different risks of contracting HIV at different points in their reproductive cycles. For example, women may be at a greater risk of contracting HIV following ovulation during the last 2 weeks of their cycle as opposed to the first 2 weeks of their cycle prior to ovulation. The difference between risk of infection before and after ovulation relates to sex hormones produced at various points in the reproductive cycle. It seems that the estrogen that is produced prior to ovulation provides a somewhat protective, although certainly not absolute, role against HIV infection. For women who do become infected with HIV, studies have shown that women in the first 3 to 5 years after HIV infection carry lower HIV viral loads than men, perhaps due to the influence of estrogen. This suggests a major role for sex hormones in the infection and progression of HIV.\n41. HIV belongs to a unique category of viruses termed retroviruses.

Retroviruses have the unique ability to transcribe their RNA to DNA (recall that the central dogma indicates DNA to RNA to protein) so that the viral genetic material can integrate into host cell chromosomes to initiate the latent phase of the life cycle. In order to transcribe the RNA to DNA, the enzyme reverse transcriptase is needed, which is indicated by choice $\\mathrm{C}$. The other choices relate to enzymes that are not specific to retroviruses. DNA polymerase is used by cells to copy DNA during the process of semiconservative replication.

This disease is one of the most common recessive genetic diseases and is often fatal. Cystic fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of abnormally thick mucus throughout the body and the loss of excess amounts of salt via sweat. The thick mucus builds up and causes major problems in the lungs, which often become infected, and can cause digestive abnormalities such as malnutrition and blockages through the intestinal tract. The severity of the disease is variable, and many other potential complications can arise.\n\nThe gene involved in cystic fibrosis is a mutated allele of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). At least 900 known mutations of this gene can lead to cystic fibrosis. The normal CFTR gene produces the CFTR protein that is a transmembrane chloride channel in cells of the lungs, digestive tract, skin, and reproductive tract. One mutation termed delta F508 has a single amino acid change in the protein that marks it for destruction before it ever reaches the membrane to complete its function. Without the proper CFTR in the membrane of cells, the chloride and sodium ion balance is altered such that not enough water leaves the cells to produce mucus of the proper consistency. The thick mucus that results accumulates and causes multiple problems, including the trapping of bacteria that can cause infections. Although there is no cure for cystic fibrosis, better management strategies have increased the life span of people with this genetic disease.\n8. Pancreatic insufficiency occurs in some cystic fibrosis patients. This means that there is a lack of digestive enzymes being secreted from the pancreas to the small intestine.

It is insoluble in water, but due to its basicity, it is soluble in acid solution.\n\nPlaque forms on teeth due to a combination of carbohydrates and proteins, called mucin, which produces a film that builds up if not removed by thorough cleaning of the teeth and gums.

The prevalence of the condition is about 1 in every 6000 newborns. The symptoms of the disease are variable in their severity, which may take years to fully develop and are often misdiagnosed. One common symptom seen in many tuberous sclerosis patients is kidney problems such as cysts. While the cysts typically cause no major problems, occasionally the cysts may bleed, which causes blood loss and anemia and may lead to kidney failure.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in two genes, tuberous sclerosis complex 1 and 2 (TSC1 and TSC2), although only one gene needs to be affected to have the disease. The TSC1 gene produces a protein called hamartin, while the TSC2 gene produces the protein tuberin. Both hamartin and tuberin act as tumor suppressors in the body. A typical pedigree for tuberous sclerosis is shown with affected individuals being shaded:\n\n\nWhile most cases of tuberous sclerosis are acquired according to the pattern shown in the pedigree, some individuals acquire tuberous sclerosis through a process called gonadal mosaicism. In these cases, the parents do not have apparent mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 in their somatic cells, but they have passed the mutation to their children.\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with tuberous sclerosis depends on the severity of their symptoms. Some common symptoms are learning disabilities, seizures, mental SECTION 1:\n\nBiological and\n\nBiochemical Foundations of Living Systems retardation, skin abnormalities, and kidney failure. Most individuals with tuberous\n\nsclerosis live to a normal life expectancy.\n7.

        "Solution": "7. The correct answer is D. Sex-linked inheritance can be quickly eliminated as males and females seem to be equally affected based on the pedigree. Since autosomal inheritance is obvious, it is necessary to determine if the pattern is characteristic of a dominant or recessive condition. Recessive traits are notorious for \"skipping generations\" in pedigrees, which means that affected children often come from unaffected parents. To be affected, the individual must be homozygous recessive. The parents do not have the disease, but they are unknowing carriers (heterozygotes), which gives them a $25 \\%$ chance of having an affected offspring. In dominant autosomal inheritance, the affected individual can be homozygous dominant or heterozygous. This means that in order for a child to have the disease, the child must have inherited at least one mutated allele from his or her parent who also had the disease. The only exception would be if spontaneous mutation occurred. When affected individuals appear in each generation of a pedigree, dominance should be suspected.",

Water that is reabsorbed in the nephrons returns to the bloodstream to increase plasma volume, which in turn increases blood pressure as the volume of blood increases. When the nephrons absorb more water to increase blood volume, the urine volume decreases. The two hormones aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone help increase the amount of water reabsorbed by nephrons, which in turn decreases urine volume. In order to reduce blood pressure, the kidneys can decrease the amount of water reabsorbed by the nephrons. The less water reabsorbed means there will be less blood volume and less blood pressure. This would ultimately increase urine volume. The question asks how the kidneys might try to reduce hypertension. This would mean that we want less water reabsorbed into the blood, which would decrease blood volume and blood pressure. To do this, urine volume would have to increase.",

The goal of creating GM foods is to modify the organisms to express new and useful traits. A few examples involve engineering crops to be resistant to bacterial or viral infections, to be resistant to herbicides, to ripen more slowly, to survive extreme temperature changes, to contain vaccines, or to create crops that are more nutritious.\n\nOne GM food that has received media attention over the years is golden rice. This GM product was first introduced in 2000 and was engineered to provide carotene that is a precursor to vitamin $\\mathrm{A}$. The carotene in the rice provides the golden color. Vitamin A deficiency is a major problem in underdeveloped parts of the world, killing more than one million people a year, most of whom are children. This vitamin is critical for the development and maintenance of epithelial tissues, for vision, and for growth.\n\nRice plants normally produce carotene in the inedible parts of the plant. To be able to access and use the carotene, it was necessary to engineer the rice to produce it in the edible grains. In order to achieve this goal, two genes from daffodil plants, psy and $l y c$, and a bacterial gene called $c r t 1$ were added to the rice genome. These genes engineered a pathway that produces lycopene, which is eventually converted to carotene. Each of these genes was placed under the control of a grain-specific promoter so that the products were produced in the rice grains.\n\nWhile golden rice was produced to provide carotene, which the human body can convert into the essential vitamin A, the rice provided much less carotene than was anticipated. Golden rice 2, a modified version released in 2005, contains a much larger amount of carotene and, as such, is a better source of the vitamin. Field tests were conducted in 2009, and human consumption trials were completed in 2012. However, neither version has been grown in large-scale quantities at this time.\n44.

The purpose of blood doping is to provide an endurance advantage to the athlete. There are several ways to induce erythrocythemia, including the injection of synthetic oxygen carriers, blood transfusions, and the injection of hormones.\n\nSynthetic oxygen carriers are modified proteins that have a relatively high affinity for oxygen. These can provide short-term increases in the oxygen-carrying ability of blood, but they are quickly degraded. Blood transfusions can be used right before an athletic event. The transfused erythrocytes can be homologous in nature, meaning that they are harvested from a donor's blood, or they can be autologous, meaning they are removed from the athlete 5 to 10 weeks before the event and stored. The cells are then reinfused right before an athletic event. Another approach to blood doping involves injections of the hormone erythropoietin (EPO). The EPO used for this purpose is a recombinant molecule. It is available by prescription for certain medical conditions, but it has been widely abused by some athletes.\n\nTesting for blood doping is not always conclusive. For autologous or homologous transfusions, the only indicator of doping is an elevated hematocrit or hemoglobin count, which is not conclusive evidence of doping. If EPO is being used, it can be detected in the urine but only for short periods. Further, the recombinant version of EPO is hard to distinguish from the natural version, and certain other proteins present in the urine may resemble EPO.\n54. Some athletes prefer the use of autologous transfusions as compared to homologous transfusions. What would be a potential benefit of an autologous transfusion?\n\nA.

It is produced by vascular endothelium, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle cells. Because the half-life of NO is only a few seconds, its effects are short lived, but it is nevertheless essential to many of the body's regulation processes. A few of the known roles of NO include control over blood vessel dilation and pressure, involvement in inflammation, neurotransmission, and the regulation of apoptosis (programmed cell death). It is suspected that NO has many other roles in the body that are yet to be completely understood.\n\nNO is produced in cells when a group of enzymes known as nitric oxide synthases (NOS) convert the amino acid L-arginine to L-citrulline. NO is produced as a by-product of the reaction. The activity of NO is modulated by cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP). When present, cGMP increases the vasodilating abilities of NO. The expression of phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes causes the degradation of cGMP that suppresses the function of NO.\n\nBecause NO acts as a smooth muscle vasodilator, a variety of pharmaceuticals that act on NO have been developed. Nitroglycerin, which decreases the amount of oxygen flowing to the myocardium of the heart, is often used to manage the chest pain of angina that is associated with coronary artery disease. Drugs for erectile dysfunction (ED) such as Viagra, Cialis, and Levitra all work by enhancing NO function and increasing vasodilation and blood flow in the penis during sexual stimulation. Even the nutritional supplement industry has tried to manipulate the effects of NO.

Local anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation in a particular area, while general anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation along with loss of consciousness. Both procaine (also known as novocaine) and lidocaine are drugs used for local anesthesia, and they have similar mechanisms of action. The drugs affect neurons in the local areas to which they are applied by preventing the opening of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels in the neurons.\n\nProcaine and lidocaine have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, procaine has the ability to cause vasoconstriction in addition to its analgesic properties. However, lidocaine induces anesthesia faster and for a longer period of time than procaine. In addition to being used as an anesthetic, lidocaine is often used in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation, a condition where the cardiac muscle displays rapid, uncoordinated, and weak rhythms. The drug causes decreased excitability of the ventricles by blocking $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels, while the sinoatrial node in the right atrium is unaffected by the drug.\n\nProcaine has a half-life of up to $0.5$ hours in patients. When procaine is metabolized in the body, it is converted to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the plasma by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase, and PABA is then excreted by the kidneys. Lidocaine is twice as potent as procaine, but lidocaine is also twice as toxic. The half-life of lidocaine in patients is typically between $1.5$ and 2 hours. Lidocaine is metabolized in the liver by two enzymes that produce the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide.

It involves a system of communication between organisms that is dependent on population density. Bacteria are notorious for using quorum sensing (QS) via the secretion of secreted signaling molecules, called autoinducers (AI), to coordinate their gene expression once a threshold density of population is reached. Not only can bacteria communicate via QS within their species, but they can also cross-talk through QS between different species. In order to participate in quorum sensing, bacteria require a way to produce an autoinducer and a way to respond to autoinducers via binding to specific receptors.\n\nOne example of how bacteria use quorum sensing to their advantage is to regulate the gene expression of virulence factors. During infection, if a small number of bacteria were to express their virulence factors, this would largely have no impact on the host. Instead, bacteria wait until a quorum is reached in terms of population size, indicating that the population is large enough to express virulence factors. These virulence factors relate to such abilities as escaping the immune response, invasion, and spreading within the host.\n\nWe know that we are facing a current healthcare crisis related to the loss of effectiveness of many traditional types of antibiotics based on bacterial resistance. This provides a major impetus for identifying novel ways to target bacterial pathogens that avoid the use of antibiotics. Several chemical compounds and molecules have been identified as facilitators of quorum sensing inhibition. Typically, these factors can serve as signal-targeting enzymes or small-molecule inhibitors of signal synthases and receptors.\n41. N-Acyl homoserine lactones (N-AHLs) are one type of autoinducer produced by certain species of bacteria.

They come in many varieties and play numerous roles in modulating all aspects of the immune response. Interleukins are produced by many types of cells, and their secretion occurs rapidly, and typically briefly, as needed. Interleukins travel to target cells where they bind to receptors on the target cell, ultimately causing a cascade of events in the target that alter the behavior of that cell. Different types of microbes stimulate the release of different types of interleukins. The type of interleukins secreted will ultimately influence how the system responds to the infection.\n\nAn immunologist suspects that a recently discovered interleukin called interleukin X might be important in protecting against hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection.

The goal of creating GM foods is to modify the organisms to express new and useful traits. A few examples involve engineering crops to be resistant to bacterial or viral infections, to be resistant to herbicides, to ripen more slowly, to survive extreme temperature changes, to contain vaccines, or to create crops that are more nutritious.\n\nOne GM food that has received media attention over the years is golden rice. This GM product was first introduced in 2000 and was engineered to provide carotene that is a precursor to vitamin $\\mathrm{A}$. The carotene in the rice provides the golden color. Vitamin A deficiency is a major problem in underdeveloped parts of the world, killing more than one million people a year, most of whom are children. This vitamin is critical for the development and maintenance of epithelial tissues, for vision, and for growth.\n\nRice plants normally produce carotene in the inedible parts of the plant. To be able to access and use the carotene, it was necessary to engineer the rice to produce it in the edible grains. In order to achieve this goal, two genes from daffodil plants, psy and $l y c$, and a bacterial gene called $c r t 1$ were added to the rice genome. These genes engineered a pathway that produces lycopene, which is eventually converted to carotene. Each of these genes was placed under the control of a grain-specific promoter so that the products were produced in the rice grains.\n\nWhile golden rice was produced to provide carotene, which the human body can convert into the essential vitamin A, the rice provided much less carotene than was anticipated. Golden rice 2, a modified version released in 2005, contains a much larger amount of carotene and, as such, is a better source of the vitamin. Field tests were conducted in 2009, and human consumption trials were completed in 2012. However, neither version has been grown in large-scale quantities at this time.\n45.

Failure of the kidneys or respiratory system can have drastic consequences on the body's ability to regulate blood $\\mathrm{pH}$. In order to regulate $\\mathrm{pH}$ in the blood, a buffering system is used, which is shown. This reaction is completely reversible and is driven in either direction depending on the concentration of the reactants. A change to one item in this reaction will in turn affect the concentration of all of the other items. These reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase:\n\n\nGenerally, there are not many problems with the body's ability to have plenty of $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ ions in reserve. However, if $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ion levels should become too low, the kidneys can generate more. In the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts of the nephrons, carbonic anhydrase converts $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ into $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which dissociates into $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Kidney failure or damage to the carbonic anhydrase enzyme can cause major problems in the ability to regulate blood $\\mathrm{pH}$.\n\nWhen the kidneys fail, their functions must be mimicked or death will occur.

An edible vaccine is a genetically modified organism (GMO) that is created when genes from the bacteria or virus being vaccinated against are inserted into plant cells. As the plants grow, they produce proteins from the bacteria or virus that the researchers are attempting to vaccinate against. When a person eats the plant, the viral or bacteria proteins serve as antigens, which initiates a primary immune response.\n\nSome of the plants that are of interest in edible vaccine development are bananas, potatoes, tomatoes, corn, rice, tobacco, and soybeans. While early research focused on growing crops that produced edible products such as bananas, the most recent research is focused on extracting material from the leaves and seeds of the plants, dehydrating it, and putting it into capsules that can be swallowed. This allows for a more predictable dosage of the vaccine and eliminates concerns that the crops containing the vaccine would be accidentally eaten by individuals who are not in need of the vaccine. The term edible vaccine has now been replaced with the term plantderived oral vaccine.\n\nThe development of plant-derived oral vaccines solves many problems associated with injectable vaccines. Because plant-derived oral vaccines are grown in crops, there is no problem with storage or refrigeration that is required of most traditional vaccines. These plant-derived vaccines also require no special training to administer. Additionally, when a vaccine is taken orally, it provides mucosal immunity due to the production of IgA antibodies by the immune system-in addition to systemic immunity. Since 90 percent of diseases enter the body through a mucus membrane, a vaccine that coerces mucosal immunity is of great benefit in the prevention of many diseases.\n30.

The uptake of water from the roots, through the stem, and into the tissue of the plant occurs via capillary actionthe motion of fluid through extremely small vessels or tubes. Capillary action involves the interaction of the following two types of forces: adhesive forces that allow the water's molecules to adhere or stick to the plant tissues and cohesive forces that provide an attraction between water molecules. Upward movement of the water through the capillary vessels occurs when the adhesive forces are greater than the cohesive forces. The height, $h$, that the water will ascend up the plant depends upon the surface tension, $T$, of the water according to the equation:\n\n$$\nh=\\frac{2 T}{\\rho g r}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density of water $\\left(=1000 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\right), g$ is the acceleration due to gravity $\\left(=9.8 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}\\right)$, and $r$ is the radius of the plant stem.\n\nTo explore capillary action, the following experiment was conducted to determine the effects of sugar in water transported up the stem of identical carnation flowers. Three beakers were each filled with $0.5 \\mathrm{~L}$ of water. One beaker (beaker 1) was set aside with no sugar added to the water. Fifteen grams of sugar was added to the water in the second beaker (beaker 2), and 30 grams of sugar was added to the water in the third beaker (beaker 3). Also added to each beaker were 10 drops of red food dye. A carnation was placed in each beaker and observed at 2-hour intervals, marking the height of the dye in the carnation stem. The data are presented in the following table:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{cccc}\n\\hline Time (hr) & Height of Dye $(\\mathbf{c m})$ Beaker 1: No Sugar & Height of Dye $(\\mathbf{c m})$ Beaker 2: 15 g Sugar & Height of Dye $(\\mathbf{c m})$ Beaker 3: 30 g Sugar \\\\\n\\hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2 & $2.41$ & $0.32$ & $0.15$ \\\\\n4 & $4.17$ & $1.69$ & $0.80$ \\\\\n6 & $5.93$ & $3.06$ & $1.45$ \\\\\n8 & $7.69$ & $4.43$ & $2.10$ \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nSECTION 2:\n\nChemical and\n\nPhysical\n\nFoundations of Biological Systems MCAT\n35.

The weight of the water is reflected by the term $\\rho g$, which must be pulled up the stem by the surface tension.

Antibiotic resistance that develops in bacteria is an excellent example of evolutionary selection in action. Spontaneous mutations in bacteria will happen in nature. Due to random chance, some of these mutations provide bacteria the ability to survive in the presence of antibiotics that would normally kill them. These mutations can provide advantages to the bacteria such as the ability to degrade the antibiotics with enzymes, the ability to pump the antibiotic out of the cell, the ability to prevent the antibiotic from entering the cell, and the ability to change target molecules in the cell so that the antibiotic is unable to affect its target. Additionally, most antibiotic-resistance genes can easily be passed from a resistant bacterium to a nonresistant bacterium via the process of conjugation. Transduction by viruses can also carry resistance genes from one bacterium to another. It becomes very easy for an entire bacterial population to become resistant to an antibiotic in a very short period.\n\nAntibiotic resistance is a major public health concern because as bacteria develop resistance to certain antibiotics, those antibiotics are no longer capable of eliminating infections caused by resistant bacteria. Further, some bacteria are able to acquire mutations that provide them with resistance to multiple antibiotics. One such example is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This type of bacteria can be carried asymptomatically by some people and passed to others where it will cause an infection. One of the most common places for MRSA to be spread is through hospitals. The problem with MRSA is that its multiple resistance leaves it susceptible to very few antibiotics. In fact, strains of MRSA are known to show resistance to nearly every antibiotic available.\n33. Why would repeated use of antibiotics select for resistant strains of bacteria?\nA. The antibiotics would force the bacteria to mutate at a greater rate.\nB. The antibiotics would kill the susceptible bacteria, leaving only the resistant ones to multiply.\nC. The antibiotics would directly increase the rate of binary fission in resistant organisms.\nD.

Local anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation in a particular area, while general anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation along with loss of consciousness. Both procaine (also known as novocaine) and lidocaine are drugs used for local anesthesia, and they have similar mechanisms of action. The drugs affect neurons in the local areas to which they are applied by preventing the opening of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels in the neurons.\n\nProcaine and lidocaine have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, procaine has the ability to cause vasoconstriction in addition to its analgesic properties. However, lidocaine induces anesthesia faster and for a longer period of time than procaine. In addition to being used as an anesthetic, lidocaine is often used in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation, a condition where the cardiac muscle displays rapid, uncoordinated, and weak rhythms. The drug causes decreased excitability of the ventricles by blocking $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels, while the sinoatrial node in the right atrium is unaffected by the drug.\n\nProcaine has a half-life of up to $0.5$ hours in patients. When procaine is metabolized in the body, it is converted to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the plasma by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase, and PABA is then excreted by the kidneys. Lidocaine is twice as potent as procaine, but lidocaine is also twice as toxic. The half-life of lidocaine in patients is typically between $1.5$ and 2 hours. Lidocaine is metabolized in the liver by two enzymes that produce the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide.

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 8-11 are based on the following passage.\n\nBromine, discovered in the early 1800s, has an atomic number of 35 and is located in group 17. Besides being able to exist as a diatomic liquid, bromine can frequently be found in salts and is useful in preparing organic molecules with a range of functions. Some of these uses include pesticides, water purification, prescription drugs, photochemicals, and flame retardants. In some sodas, one can find brominated vegetable oil added as an emulsifying agent. In addition to its strong odor, bromine is a dark, brown-orange liquid at room temperature. Bromine has two stable isotopes, Br-79 and Br-81, and a relative atomic abundance, which causes the atomic mass of bromine to be 79.904. Bromine-80 is one of the many unstable isotopes of bromine. It readily undergoes beta decay to form $\\mathrm{Kr}-80$. Bromine can also undergo other modes of decay to form $\\mathrm{Kr}-80$. When analyzing organic compounds that have bromine in them, the mass spectrometric analysis of the compound frequently shows a peak of equal intensity at $\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z}=79$ and $\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z}=81$, or $\\mathrm{M}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{M}^{+2}$ peaks of equal height as well.\n8.

The purpose of blood doping is to provide an endurance advantage to the athlete. There are several ways to induce erythrocythemia, including the injection of synthetic oxygen carriers, blood transfusions, and the injection of hormones.\n\nSynthetic oxygen carriers are modified proteins that have a relatively high affinity for oxygen. These can provide short-term increases in the oxygen-carrying ability of blood, but they are quickly degraded. Blood transfusions can be used right before an athletic event. The transfused erythrocytes can be homologous in nature, meaning that they are harvested from a donor's blood, or they can be autologous, meaning they are removed from the athlete 5 to 10 weeks before the event and stored. The cells are then reinfused right before an athletic event. Another approach to blood doping involves injections of the hormone erythropoietin (EPO). The EPO used for this purpose is a recombinant molecule. It is available by prescription for certain medical conditions, but it has been widely abused by some athletes.\n\nTesting for blood doping is not always conclusive. For autologous or homologous transfusions, the only indicator of doping is an elevated hematocrit or hemoglobin count, which is not conclusive evidence of doping. If EPO is being used, it can be detected in the urine but only for short periods. Further, the recombinant version of EPO is hard to distinguish from the natural version, and certain other proteins present in the urine may resemble EPO.\n55.

Local anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation in a particular area, while general anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation along with loss of consciousness. Both procaine (also known as novocaine) and lidocaine are drugs used for local anesthesia, and they have similar mechanisms of action. The drugs affect neurons in the local areas to which they are applied by preventing the opening of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels in the neurons.\n\nProcaine and lidocaine have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, procaine has the ability to cause vasoconstriction in addition to its analgesic properties. However, lidocaine induces anesthesia faster and for a longer period of time than procaine. In addition to being used as an anesthetic, lidocaine is often used in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation, a condition where the cardiac muscle displays rapid, uncoordinated, and weak rhythms. The drug causes decreased excitability of the ventricles by blocking $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels, while the sinoatrial node in the right atrium is unaffected by the drug.\n\nProcaine has a half-life of up to $0.5$ hours in patients. When procaine is metabolized in the body, it is converted to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the plasma by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase, and PABA is then excreted by the kidneys. Lidocaine is twice as potent as procaine, but lidocaine is also twice as toxic. The half-life of lidocaine in patients is typically between $1.5$ and 2 hours.

The passage explains that lidocaine is metabolized in the liver and produces two metabolites: monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. If we are comparing a person with normal liver function to one with compromised liver function, there will be a difference in how long it takes to clear lidocaine from the system. If the liver function is impaired, it is expected that lidocaine will stay in the plasma longer as it waits to be metabolized by the liver. Therefore, the plasma concentration of lidocaine in the liver-compromised patient should be higher after 1 hour than in the patient with normal liver function. The faster lidocaine is metabolized by the liver, the faster the metabolites would be expected to enter the plasma and ultimately be excreted by the kidneys. Choice $C$ is correct because it suggests that one of the metabolites of lidocaine, monoethylglycinexylidide, would be processed by the liver and kidneys more quickly in the normal patient as compared to the liver-impaired patient.",

TSH activates the thyroid gland to release T3 and T4, which are stored as thyroglobulin (bound to protein). T3 is about five times more physiologically potent than T4. Thyroglobulin is enzymatically converted to T3, T4, and globulin, and T3 and T4 are released. T4 is converted in the liver to T3 and reverse T3 (RT3). About $80 \\%$ of T3 comes from T4 conversion and the other $20 \\%$ comes directly from the thyroid gland. Reverse T3 blocks the action of T3 and T4 by occupying T3 and T4 cell receptor sites. A symptom of a thyroid hormone abnormality is the swelling of the thyroid that is referred to as a goiter, which can necessitate a portion or even all of the thyroid gland being surgically removed. After the surgery, synthetic hormones are given in an attempt to regulate the metabolism. Because the thyroid also deals with calcium homeostasis, complete removal of the thyroid can cause calcium levels to become extremely low.\n\nThe following data was collected from blood drawn to complete a thyroid panel on a patient suffering from a goiter:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n\\hline & Patient Values & Expected Normal Values \\\\\n\\hline Triiodothyronine (T3) & $6.5 \\mathrm{pg} / \\mathrm{mL}$ & $2.3-4.2 \\mathrm{pg} / \\mathrm{mL}$ \\\\\nThyroxine (T4) & $14.2 \\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{dL}$ & $4.5-12 \\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{dL}$ \\\\\nThyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) & $0.10 \\mu \\mathrm{IU} / \\mathrm{mL}$ & $0.35-2.5 \\mu \\mathrm{IU} / \\mathrm{L}$ \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n51.

In addition to the CD4 receptor, there are a variety of coreceptors that are also needed for certain strains of HIV to infect cells. One of these coreceptors is called CCR5 and is needed for the most common strains of HIV (called R5) to infect their host cells. The more CCR5 receptors a cell has, the greater the rate of infection for the cell. Some individuals have the delta-32 allele of CCR5 that leads to a decreased risk of HIV infection.\n\nWomen are at a much higher risk for contracting HIV from a male partner than a male is for contracting HIV from a female partner. Some of the increased risk for women is dependent on sex hormones. It has been hypothesized that women have different risks of contracting HIV at different points in their reproductive cycles. For example, women may be at a greater risk of contracting HIV following ovulation during the last 2 weeks of their cycle as opposed to the first 2 weeks of their cycle prior to ovulation. The difference between risk of infection before and after ovulation relates to sex hormones produced at various points in the reproductive cycle. It seems that the estrogen that is produced prior to ovulation provides a somewhat protective, although certainly not absolute, role against HIV infection. For women who do become infected with HIV, studies have shown that women in the first 3 to 5 years after HIV infection carry lower HIV viral loads than men, perhaps due to the influence of estrogen. This suggests a major role for sex hormones in the infection and progression of HIV.\n38. Women are at a higher risk of contracting HIV following ovulation. Based on the normal events of the female reproductive cycle, which hormone might account for the increased risk of HIV infection in women following ovulation?\nA. increased levels of progesterone\nB. increased levels of follicle-stimulating hormone\nC. increased levels of estrogen\nD. increased levels of luteinizing hormone",

This question requires you to know some of the details of the female reproductive cycle including what hormones are involved following ovulation. Prior to ovulation, both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior pituitary and are involved in follicular growth and maturation. The secretion of both FSH and LH is stimulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone $(\\mathrm{GnRH})$ from the hypothalamus. As the follicles grow and mature, they produce estrogen.

Local anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation in a particular area, while general anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation along with loss of consciousness. Both procaine (also known as novocaine) and lidocaine are drugs used for local anesthesia, and they have similar mechanisms of action. The drugs affect neurons in the local areas to which they are applied by preventing the opening of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels in the neurons.\n\nProcaine and lidocaine have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, procaine has the ability to cause vasoconstriction in addition to its analgesic properties. However, lidocaine induces anesthesia faster and for a longer period of time than procaine. In addition to being used as an anesthetic, lidocaine is often used in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation, a condition where the cardiac muscle displays rapid, uncoordinated, and weak rhythms.

In a condition known as water intoxication, a person ingests more water (usually 3 or more liters in a single sitting) in a shorter period of time than the kidneys can process. In a child, the amount of water required to induce water intoxication is much less.\n\nAs the excess water moves from the digestive system, it accumulates in the plasma and extracellular fluids. Electrolytes such as sodium are drawn out of the cells in an attempt to equilibrate the concentrations inside and outside of the cells. As more and more water enters the extracellular fluids, the plasma sodium concentration drops, leading to a condition called hyponatremia, defined as a plasma sodium concentration less than $130 \\mathrm{mmol} /$ liter.

Additionally, these cells can be resuscitated from VBNC states to a culturable state under appropriate conditions. The VBNC state has been observed in numerous species of bacteria and most recently in yeasts.\n\nEscherichia coli is one of many species of bacteria that are able to enter and resuscitate from VBNC states.

It appears that the antibiotic therapy eliminated the culturable bacteria, so it would be safe to assume that the numbers of culturable bacteria would remain very low. This would eliminate choice A, which says that culturable cell count would increase. Since the cell counts for metabolically active cells did not decrease during the initial antibiotic treatment, there is no reason to assume that they would eventually decrease over a longer period, thus eliminating choices B and C. Based on the fact that the number of nonculturable bacteria did not decrease over the time period shown, we can assume that this is unlikely to change over a longer time course. Assuming that the trends seen in the graph continue, choice D is the most appropriate prediction.",

Formed by coupled oscillating electric and magnetic fields, electromagnetic radiation comprises all of the types of waves represented within the electromagnetic spectrum, varying in frequency, $f$, \n\nand wavelength, $\\lambda$, according to the equation, $c=f \\lambda$. In addition to its wavelike properties, electromagnetic radiation behaves as waves do. However, classic experiments in quantum physics have also discovered that light behaves as a particle. The particle of light, known as a photon, has energy $E=h f$ where $h$ is Planck's constant $\\left(h=6.63 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}\\right.$ ) and $f$ is frequency. This apparent contradiction is accepted as the \"wave-particle duality of light.\" Two classical experiments that substantiated the \"wave-particle duality of light\" were Fraunhofer single-slit diffraction and the Compton scattering (see figure).\n\n\nIn Fraunhofer single-slit diffraction, monochromatic light is incident parallel to a diffraction grating with a single slit of width $d$. The light rays will bend around the opening of the slit and project onto a flat screen located a distance, $L$, from the diffraction grating as a pattern of bright and dark fringes. The pattern of dark fringes (minima) are described by $d \\sin \\theta=m \\lambda, m=1,2,3, \\ldots$ as the integer value of the particular fringe.\n\nIn Compton scattering, a photon of initial energy $E_{\\mathrm{ph}}$ and wavelength $\\lambda_{i}$ is incident upon an electron of mass $m_{e}$, initially at rest. Upon collision, the photon is deflected with a scattered energy $E_{\\mathrm{ph}}^{\\prime}$ at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the incident axis as well as an increased wavelength, $\\lambda_{f}$, given by $\\lambda_{f}=\\lambda_{i}+\\left(\\frac{h}{m_{e} c}\\right)(1-\\cos \\theta)$ where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $m_{e}$ is the rest mass of the electron $\\left(9.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg}\\right)$.

In this case it appeared that the cancer was somehow \"contagious,\" and it was suspected that viruses were somehow involved in this infectious type of cancer. Later, it was determined that certain viruses have the ability to genetically transform normal cells to a cancerous state by inserting into the chromosomes of their host cells. The virus that caused cancer was named the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) after its founder. The RSV has only four genes. The gag gene codes for the capsid of the virus, the env gene codes for the envelope of the virus, the pol gene codes for reverse transcriptase, and the $s r c$ gene encodes for a tyrosine kinase.\n\nWithin normal cells, there are proto-oncogenes, which are involved in cell division and development. Because most cells are not reproducing all the time, protooncogenes tend to be expressed at low levels or not at all. If viral genetic material inserts into a proto-oncogene, it will be converted to an active oncogene, which stimulates excessive cell division, eventually leading to tumor development. Viruses with this ability are termed oncogenic viruses. Some viruses activate an oncogene by inserting their genetic material into a cellular proto-oncogene, whereas some oncogenic viruses actually carry oncogenes into their hosts. Whether the virus inserts into a cellular proto-oncogene or carries an oncogene into the cell, the end result is increased cell proliferation and changes in the cell, which can include lack of contact inhibition and immortality.\n30.

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 13-18 are based on the following passage.\n\nPassage III\n\nSperm count in human males is influenced by a variety of factors. One of the most important variables affecting sperm count is the number of Sertoli cells located in seminiferous tubules of the testes. The Sertoli cells' primary function is to nurture cells through the process of spermatogenesis by providing them with nutrients and an environment conducive to spermatogenesis. Each Sertoli cell has a set number of spermatozoa that it can support. Sertoli cells have an additional role in forming the blood-testis barrier that provides immune privilege for the seminiferous tubules. This forms a physical barricade that keeps the developing sperm from coming into contact with cells of the immune system.\n\nWhile it is not clear as to all the factors involved in determining Sertoli cell number, it is apparent that their development is most critical during the first nine months of life and prior to puberty. Events that affect the development of Sertoli cells in young males can influence fertility later in life. There may also be genetic factors involved in determining the number of Sertoli cells formed in a particular male.\n\nThe following data were collected from two groups of men. The men in group 1 had a normal sperm count while the men in group 2 were seeking infertility treatment due to a low sperm count. Levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary were measured as were the testicular hormones inhibin-B and testosterone in an attempt to determine which hormones seem to be linked to reduced sperm count.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccc}\n\\hline Sample Group & LH & FSH & Inhibin-B & Testosterone \\\\\n\\hline 1 & $5.3 \\mathrm{IU} / \\mathrm{L}$ & $5.0 \\mathrm{IU} / \\mathrm{L}$ & $190 \\mathrm{pg} / \\mathrm{mL}$ & $18.0 \\mathrm{nmol} / \\mathrm{L}$ \\\\\n2 & $3.1 \\mathrm{IU} / \\mathrm{L}$ & $17.6 \\mathrm{IU} / \\mathrm{L}$ & $51 \\mathrm{pg} / \\mathrm{mL}$ & $17.8 \\mathrm{nmol} / \\mathrm{L}$ \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n16.

To answer this question, Answers and Explanations Passage III MCAT\n\nyou need to think about how the sperm cells in the testes would compare to other cells in the body. Sperm cells are haploid, and all are genetically different from each other and from other cells in the body. Because they are genetically different, they should express unique surface antigens. If the cells of the immune system were to contact the sperm, they would be perceived as foreign and could be subject to immune system attack, which would destroy the sperm. For this reason, the blood-testis barrier is required to keep the sperm away from the immune cells. The remaining choices do not make good sense. Sperm cells will eventually leave the reproductive system during ejaculation. It also would not make sense to indicate that the blood flow to the testes needs to be cut off. This would prevent oxygen and nutrient flow to the area. Preventing the sperm from moving to the epididymis before they are ready does not provide an explanation for why the sperm cells need to be kept separate from the cells of the immune system.",

In an adult, the kidneys are typically capable of processing about 1 to $1.5$ liters of water per hour depending on the individual and conditions within the body. In a condition known as water intoxication, a person ingests more water (usually 3 or more liters in a single sitting) in a shorter period of time than the kidneys can process. In a child, the amount of water required to induce water intoxication is much less.\n\nAs the excess water moves from the digestive system, it accumulates in the plasma and extracellular fluids. Electrolytes such as sodium are drawn out of the cells in an attempt to equilibrate the concentrations inside and outside of the cells. As more and more water enters the extracellular fluids, the plasma sodium concentration drops, leading to a condition called hyponatremia, defined as a plasma sodium concentration less than $130 \\mathrm{mmol} /$ liter. Due to the effects of osmosis, water begins entering the cells. The cells will begin to swell and may eventually burst, if the condition is not reversed in a timely manner.\n\nThe situation becomes increasingly problematic as the cells and tissues of the central nervous system take in more water. Pressure builds in the brain that causes symptoms that resemble alcohol intoxication. Lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, and headaches are typical as well.

Local anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation in a particular area, while general anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation along with loss of consciousness. Both procaine (also known as novocaine) and lidocaine are drugs used for local anesthesia, and they have similar mechanisms of action. The drugs affect neurons in the local areas to which they are applied by preventing the opening of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels in the neurons.\n\nProcaine and lidocaine have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, procaine has the ability to cause vasoconstriction in addition to its analgesic properties. However, lidocaine induces anesthesia faster and for a longer period of time than procaine. In addition to being used as an anesthetic, lidocaine is often used in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation, a condition where the cardiac muscle displays rapid, uncoordinated, and weak rhythms. The drug causes decreased excitability of the ventricles by blocking $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels, while the sinoatrial node in the right atrium is unaffected by the drug.\n\nProcaine has a half-life of up to $0.5$ hours in patients. When procaine is metabolized in the body, it is converted to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the plasma by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase, and PABA is then excreted by the kidneys. Lidocaine is twice as potent as procaine, but lidocaine is also twice as toxic. The half-life of lidocaine in patients is typically between $1.5$ and 2 hours. Lidocaine is metabolized in the liver by two enzymes that produce the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide.

In addition to the CD4 receptor, there are a variety of coreceptors that are also needed for certain strains of HIV to infect cells. One of these coreceptors is called CCR5 and is needed for the most common strains of HIV (called R5) to infect their host cells. The more CCR5 receptors a cell has, the greater the rate of infection for the cell. Some individuals have the delta-32 allele of CCR5 that leads to a decreased risk of HIV infection.\n\nWomen are at a much higher risk for contracting HIV from a male partner than a male is for contracting HIV from a female partner. Some of the increased risk for women is dependent on sex hormones. It has been hypothesized that women have different risks of contracting HIV at different points in their reproductive cycles. For example, women may be at a greater risk of contracting HIV following ovulation during the last 2 weeks of their cycle as opposed to the first 2 weeks of their cycle prior to ovulation. The difference between risk of infection before and after ovulation relates to sex hormones produced at various points in the reproductive cycle. It seems that the estrogen that is produced prior to ovulation provides a somewhat protective, although certainly not absolute, role against HIV infection. For women who do become infected with HIV, studies have shown that women in the first 3 to 5 years after HIV infection carry lower HIV viral loads than men, perhaps due to the influence of estrogen. This suggests a major role for sex hormones in the infection and progression of HIV.\n42. Drugs such as AZT and ddI are nucleoside analogs used in HIV-infected patients.

Antibiotic resistance that develops in bacteria is an excellent example of evolutionary selection in action. Spontaneous mutations in bacteria will happen in nature. Due to random chance, some of these mutations provide bacteria the ability to survive in the presence of antibiotics that would normally kill them. These mutations can provide advantages to the bacteria such as the ability to degrade the antibiotics with enzymes, the ability to pump the antibiotic out of the cell, the ability to prevent the antibiotic from entering the cell, and the ability to change target molecules in the cell so that the antibiotic is unable to affect its target. Additionally, most antibiotic-resistance genes can easily be passed from a resistant bacterium to a nonresistant bacterium via the process of conjugation. Transduction by viruses can also carry resistance genes from one bacterium to another. It becomes very easy for an entire bacterial population to become resistant to an antibiotic in a very short period.\n\nAntibiotic resistance is a major public health concern because as bacteria develop resistance to certain antibiotics, those antibiotics are no longer capable of eliminating infections caused by resistant bacteria. Further, some bacteria are able to acquire mutations that provide them with resistance to multiple antibiotics. One such example is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This type of bacteria can be carried asymptomatically by some people and passed to others where it will cause an infection. One of the most common places for MRSA to be spread is through hospitals. The problem with MRSA is that its multiple resistance leaves it susceptible to very few antibiotics. In fact, strains of MRSA are known to show resistance to nearly every antibiotic available.\n35. A variety of biotechnology techniques have been developed that allow for manipulated gene transfer. Often, antibiotic-resistance genes are purposefully transferred along with the gene of interest. Why would this be important?\nA. to make sure that the transformed cells can survive in the presence of antibiotics\nB. to be able to use antibiotics as a marker to select between transformed and nontransformed cells\nC. the antibiotic-resistance genes happen to be near the gene of interest being transferred\nD. to prevent infection of the transformed cells",

This question requires you to locate the most logical explanation as to why antibiotic genes are often purposefully transferred along with a gene of interest in biotechnology procedures. Because the question does not provide information on what type of cells are being transformed, don't assume anything. Choice A suggests that you need resistance genes transferred so the cells can survive in the presence of antibiotics. If the cells transformed are not bacterial, they would survive anyway, as antibiotics would target and kill only bacteria. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ suggests that the antibiotic genes are transferred out of convenience because they happen to be near the gene of interest. If the gene of interest is not coming from bacteria, then there could not be any antibiotic resistance genes nearby. Choice D really doesn't offer much in the way of logic, suggesting that antibiotic resistance would be necessary to prevent infection in transformed cells. The only logical explanation is choice B. In order to determine if a cell was transformed with the gene of interest or not, antibiotics could be added. The transformed cells that picked up the gene of interest would also pick up the antibiotic resistance marker and would grow in the presence of antibiotics.

It is produced by vascular endothelium, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle cells. Because the half-life of NO is only a few seconds, its effects are short lived, but it is nevertheless essential to many of the body's regulation processes. A few of the known roles of NO include control over blood vessel dilation and pressure, involvement in inflammation, neurotransmission, and the regulation of apoptosis (programmed cell death). It is suspected that NO has many other roles in the body that are yet to be completely understood.\n\nNO is produced in cells when a group of enzymes known as nitric oxide synthases (NOS) convert the amino acid L-arginine to L-citrulline. NO is produced as a by-product of the reaction. The activity of NO is modulated by cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP). When present, cGMP increases the vasodilating abilities of NO. The expression of phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes causes the degradation of cGMP that suppresses the function of NO.\n\nBecause NO acts as a smooth muscle vasodilator, a variety of pharmaceuticals that act on NO have been developed. Nitroglycerin, which decreases the amount of oxygen flowing to the myocardium of the heart, is often used to manage the chest pain of angina that is associated with coronary artery disease. Drugs for erectile dysfunction (ED) such as Viagra, Cialis, and Levitra all work by enhancing NO function and increasing vasodilation and blood flow in the penis during sexual stimulation. Even the nutritional supplement industry has tried to manipulate the effects of NO. Bodybuilders and athletes have been using what are termed NO hemodilators, alleging that these supplements increase blood flow to muscles, making them look larger and recover faster after injury.\n15. Some of the advertisements for NO hemodilator supplements imply that the product contains NO. What would be the MOST likely ingredient in these supplements?\n\nA. The products would have to contain NO to have any of the alleged effects in the body.\n\nB.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is secreted by the pituitary gland in response to declining levels ofT3 and T4. TSH activates the thyroid gland to release T3 and T4, which are stored as thyroglobulin (bound to protein). T3 is about five times more physiologically potent than T4. Thyroglobulin is enzymatically converted to T3, T4, and globulin, and T3 and T4 are released. T4 is converted in the liver to T3 and reverse T3 (RT3). About $80 \\%$ of T3 comes from T4 conversion and the other $20 \\%$ comes directly from the thyroid gland. Reverse T3 blocks the action of T3 and T4 by occupying T3 and T4 cell receptor sites. A symptom of a thyroid hormone abnormality is the swelling of the thyroid that is referred to as a goiter, which can necessitate a portion or even all of the thyroid gland being surgically removed. After the surgery, synthetic hormones are given in an attempt to regulate the metabolism. Because the thyroid also deals with calcium homeostasis, complete removal of the thyroid can cause calcium levels to become extremely low.\n\nThe following data was collected from blood drawn to complete a thyroid panel on a patient suffering from a goiter:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\n\\hline & Patient Values & Expected Normal Values \\\\\n\\hline Triiodothyronine (T3) & $6.5 \\mathrm{pg} / \\mathrm{mL}$ & $2.3-4.2 \\mathrm{pg} / \\mathrm{mL}$ \\\\\nThyroxine (T4) & $14.2 \\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{dL}$ & $4.5-12 \\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{dL}$ \\\\\nThyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) & $0.10 \\mu \\mathrm{IU} / \\mathrm{mL}$ & $0.35-2.5 \\mu \\mathrm{IU} / \\mathrm{L}$ \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n49.

Most leukemia cases involve elevated leukocyte counts. In acute cases of leukemia, immature leukocytes proliferate quickly, which leads to many abnormal immature cells in the bone marrow. This inhibits the ability of the bone marrow to produce healthy new leukocytes. This form of the cancer progresses rapidly, and the cells metastasize easily as they move into the bloodstream from the bone marrow. It can be fatal within weeks or months if not treated promptly. In contrast, chronic cases of leukemia typically involve the proliferation of abnormal mature leukocytes. This form of the disease progresses more slowly, and treatment need not always be immediate.\n\nOnce classified as acute or chronic, leukemia can be further subdivided into lymphocytic or myelogenous. This distinction depends on which type of leukocyte is abnormal in the patient. In lymphocytic leukemia, the lymphoid cells, such as the lymphocytes, are abnormal. In the myelogenous form, the myeloid cells, such as basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils, are affected.\n\nChemotherapy drugs are often used in the management of leukemia cases. There are numerous categories of these drugs, and they have varied mechanisms of action. In treatment, several drugs are used in combination because some of the drugs are cell-cycle specific while others are not. Alkylating agents are capable of disrupting the function of DNA. Tubulin-binding agents are designed to interfere with microtubule formation. Other drugs are designed to interfere with DNA polymerase, DNA repair mechanisms, or protein synthesis, or to act as purine analogs. Many of these drugs cannot enter into the brain when injected or ingested, so if the cancer has spread to\n\nthis area, special methods must be used to introduce the drugs to the brain.\n2.

While normal culturing methods cannot detect these VBNC cells, there are a variety of molecular assays that can be used to indicate metabolic activity in the cells. Additionally, these cells can be resuscitated from VBNC states to a culturable state under appropriate conditions. The VBNC state has been observed in numerous species of bacteria and most recently in yeasts.\n\nEscherichia coli is one of many species of bacteria that are able to enter and resuscitate from VBNC states. Certain strains of $E$. coli cause a variety of infections in humans. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are frequently caused by $E$. coli that exist as harmless residents in the intestinal tract. These infections can be treated using antibiotics to kill the E. coli. However, about 30 percent of women treated for UTIs end up with a recurrence. For those who support the VBNC theory, it has been hypothesized that recurrent UTIs are caused by VBNC E. coli that resuscitate to initiate a new infection. These VBNC cells may not be killed using antibiotic therapies normally used to treat UTIs. Only culturable cells cause the symptoms of a UTI.\n\nThe following graph shows the number of E. coli bacteria present in a patient following antibiotic therapy for a UTI.

The infection is quite common after surgeries when soft tissues become infected and the infection moves to the adjacent bones. The long bones of children are particularly susceptible as they have excellent circulation to them during the growth period. In adults, the best circulation is to the vertebrae, and these are the bones that are most likely to develop osteomyelitis.\n\nOsteomyelitis is treated with various antibiotics, but some patients have chronic infections that are not eradicated by antibiotic therapy due to a unique feature of S. aureus. S. aureus can be internalized by osteoblasts where the bacteria can continue to survive in the intracellular environment. Inside the osteoblasts, bacteria can induce apoptosis, killing their host cell. Surgical debridement is often required to remove the damaged and dead bone tissue created by the infection.\n\nA major research question deals with how an S. aureus infection induces apoptosis in the host osteoblasts. In order for apoptosis to initiate in osteoblasts, the enzyme capsase-8 must be activated. This enzyme serves as a protease that cleaves critical proteins in the cell, causing cell death.

One of the most important variables affecting sperm count is the number of Sertoli cells located in seminiferous tubules of the testes. The Sertoli cells' primary function is to nurture cells through the process of spermatogenesis by providing them with nutrients and an environment conducive to spermatogenesis. Each Sertoli cell has a set number of spermatozoa that it can support. Sertoli cells have an additional role in forming the blood-testis barrier that provides immune privilege for the seminiferous tubules. This forms a physical barricade that keeps the developing sperm from coming into contact with cells of the immune system.\n\nWhile it is not clear as to all the factors involved in determining Sertoli cell number, it is apparent that their development is most critical during the first nine months of life and prior to puberty. Events that affect the development of Sertoli cells in young males can influence fertility later in life.

        "Solution": "17. The correct answer is $\\mathrm{B}$. This question relies on your knowledge of the female reproductive cycle. In women, as FSH levels climb, follicles are stimulated to grow. These follicles produce estrogen, which exerts positive feedback on LH, whose levels begin to climb. When LH levels peak on the 14 th day of the cycle, the follicle ruptures, releasing the egg from the ovary and leaving the corpus luteum behind in the ovary. After ovulation, the corpus luteum secretes both estrogen and progesterone to inhibit GnRH. When GnRH is inhibited, FSH and LH will also be inhibited. Choice B correctly indicates that the LH surge causes ovulation.",

Social behavior can involve either shallow acting or deep acting. Shallow acting requires altering facial expressions and body language so that on the surface, the individual conveys an emotion or opinion to conform to the social situation but does not really experience that emotion/opinion. Deep acting requires alteration of inner beliefs such that the individual believes the emotion or opinion he or she is expressing in order to conform to the situation.\n\nIn one study, deep acting and shallow acting in a social situation were examined for customer-service workers. These workers routinely interacted with customers by smiling at them, speaking with them, responding to their queries, and detailing the benefits of various products. Later, stress was assessed for these workers.\n\nHypothetical results are depicted in the following figure.\n\n\nPerceived stress from social interactions involving deep acting and shallow acting.\n47.

They come in many varieties and play numerous roles in modulating all aspects of the immune response. Interleukins are produced by many types of cells, and their secretion occurs rapidly, and typically briefly, as needed. Interleukins travel to target cells where they bind to receptors on the target cell, ultimately causing a cascade of events in the target that alter the behavior of that cell. Different types of microbes stimulate the release of different types of interleukins. The type of interleukins secreted will ultimately influence how the system responds to the infection.\n\nAn immunologist suspects that a recently discovered interleukin called interleukin X might be important in protecting against hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection.

Antibiotic resistance that develops in bacteria is an excellent example of evolutionary selection in action. Spontaneous mutations in bacteria will happen in nature. Due to random chance, some of these mutations provide bacteria the ability to survive in the presence of antibiotics that would normally kill them. These mutations can provide advantages to the bacteria such as the ability to degrade the antibiotics with enzymes, the ability to pump the antibiotic out of the cell, the ability to prevent the antibiotic from entering the cell, and the ability to change target molecules in the cell so that the antibiotic is unable to affect its target. Additionally, most antibiotic-resistance genes can easily be passed from a resistant bacterium to a nonresistant bacterium via the process of conjugation. Transduction by viruses can also carry resistance genes from one bacterium to another. It becomes very easy for an entire bacterial population to become resistant to an antibiotic in a very short period.\n\nAntibiotic resistance is a major public health concern because as bacteria develop resistance to certain antibiotics, those antibiotics are no longer capable of eliminating infections caused by resistant bacteria. Further, some bacteria are able to acquire mutations that provide them with resistance to multiple antibiotics. One such example is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This type of bacteria can be carried asymptomatically by some people and passed to others where it will cause an infection. One of the most common places for MRSA to be spread is through hospitals. The problem with MRSA is that its multiple resistance leaves it susceptible to very few antibiotics. In fact, strains of MRSA are known to show resistance to nearly every antibiotic available.\n36.

The prevalence of the condition is about 1 in every 6000 newborns. The symptoms of the disease are variable in their severity, which may take years to fully develop and are often misdiagnosed. One common symptom seen in many tuberous sclerosis patients is kidney problems such as cysts. While the cysts typically cause no major problems, occasionally the cysts may bleed, which causes blood loss and anemia and may lead to kidney failure.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in two genes, tuberous sclerosis complex 1 and 2 (TSC1 and TSC2), although only one gene needs to be affected to have the disease. The TSC1 gene produces a protein called hamartin, while the TSC2 gene produces the protein tuberin. Both hamartin and tuberin act as tumor suppressors in the body. A typical pedigree for tuberous sclerosis is shown with affected individuals being shaded:\n\n\nWhile most cases of tuberous sclerosis are acquired according to the pattern shown in the pedigree, some individuals acquire tuberous sclerosis through a process called gonadal mosaicism. In these cases, the parents do not have apparent mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 in their somatic cells, but they have passed the mutation to their children.\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with tuberous sclerosis depends on the severity of their symptoms.

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 16-20 are based on the following passage.\n\n\\section{Passage III}\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is often described in physics textbooks as a transverse wave that travels in a vacuum at a speed of $c=3 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Formed by coupled oscillating electric and magnetic fields, electromagnetic radiation comprises all of the types of waves represented within the electromagnetic spectrum, varying in frequency, $f$, \n\nand wavelength, $\\lambda$, according to the equation, $c=f \\lambda$. In addition to its wavelike properties, electromagnetic radiation behaves as waves do. However, classic experiments in quantum physics have also discovered that light behaves as a particle. The particle of light, known as a photon, has energy $E=h f$ where $h$ is Planck's constant $\\left(h=6.63 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}\\right.$ ) and $f$ is frequency. This apparent contradiction is accepted as the \"wave-particle duality of light.\" Two classical experiments that substantiated the \"wave-particle duality of light\" were Fraunhofer single-slit diffraction and the Compton scattering (see figure).\n\n\nIn Fraunhofer single-slit diffraction, monochromatic light is incident parallel to a diffraction grating with a single slit of width $d$. The light rays will bend around the opening of the slit and project onto a flat screen located a distance, $L$, from the diffraction grating as a pattern of bright and dark fringes. The pattern of dark fringes (minima) are described by $d \\sin \\theta=m \\lambda, m=1,2,3, \\ldots$ as the integer value of the particular fringe.\n\nIn Compton scattering, a photon of initial energy $E_{\\mathrm{ph}}$ and wavelength $\\lambda_{i}$ is incident upon an electron of mass $m_{e}$, initially at rest. Upon collision, the photon is deflected with a scattered energy $E_{\\mathrm{ph}}^{\\prime}$ at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the incident axis as well as an increased wavelength, $\\lambda_{f}$, given by $\\lambda_{f}=\\lambda_{i}+\\left(\\frac{h}{m_{e} c}\\right)(1-\\cos \\theta)$ where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $m_{e}$ is the rest mass of the electron $\\left(9.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg}\\right)$. The Compton-scattered electron scatters with an energy $E_{\\mathrm{el}}$ at an angle $\\varphi$.\n16.

Single-slit diffraction supports the wave nature of light, whereas Compton scattering supports the particle nature of light.\n\nB. Single-slit diffraction supports the particle nature of light, whereas Compton scattering supports the wave nature of light.\n\nC. Both single-slit diffraction and Compton scattering support the wave nature of light.\n\nD. Both single-slit diffraction and Compton scattering support the particle nature of light.",

In single-slit diffraction, light (electromagnetic radiation) passes through a small slit within a diffraction grating and moves toward a screen as wavefronts. As the wavefronts strike the screen, points within the wavefronts will either amplify as a result of constructive interference or cancel each other as a result of destructive interference. The alternating patterns of constructive and destructive interference will result in a pattern of bright and dark fringes on the screen. This observation is indicative of the wavelike behavior of light. Compton scattering involves a two-dimensional elastic collision that can take place only if particles are involved. An electron is a particle, and thus in order to observe the Compton effect, light (electromagnetic radiation) must also behave as a particle.",

In this case it appeared that the cancer was somehow \"contagious,\" and it was suspected that viruses were somehow involved in this infectious type of cancer. Later, it was determined that certain viruses have the ability to genetically transform normal cells to a cancerous state by inserting into the chromosomes of their host cells. The virus that caused cancer was named the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) after its founder. The RSV has only four genes. The gag gene codes for the capsid of the virus, the env gene codes for the envelope of the virus, the pol gene codes for reverse transcriptase, and the $s r c$ gene encodes for a tyrosine kinase.\n\nWithin normal cells, there are proto-oncogenes, which are involved in cell division and development. Because most cells are not reproducing all the time, protooncogenes tend to be expressed at low levels or not at all. If viral genetic material inserts into a proto-oncogene, it will be converted to an active oncogene, which stimulates excessive cell division, eventually leading to tumor development. Viruses with this ability are termed oncogenic viruses. Some viruses activate an oncogene by inserting their genetic material into a cellular proto-oncogene, whereas some oncogenic viruses actually carry oncogenes into their hosts. Whether the virus inserts into a cellular proto-oncogene or carries an oncogene into the cell, the end result is increased cell proliferation and changes in the cell, which can include lack of contact inhibition and immortality.\n31. It is known that some viruses carry activated oncogenes into their hosts. What is the BEST explanation for how a virus could acquire an oncogene?\nA. The virus spontaneously mutates.\nB. The virus acquires the oncogene via conjugation with another virus.\nC. The virus is transformed by DNA from another source.\nD. The virus acquired the oncogene from a previous host.",

In order for a virus to carry an oncogene into its host, that virus must be derived from a virus that picked up the gene from a former host cell. Spontaneous mutation alone could not account for a virus acquiring an entire proto-oncogene, which eliminates choice A. Viruses do not conjugate, so choice B can be eliminated as well. Transformation occurs when a cell incorporates foreign DNA from its environment into its own genome. This occurs with bacteria but not viruses, meaning that choice $\\mathrm{C}$ can also be eliminated. This leaves transduction as the only choice. When a virus excises from the host chromosome, it can take with it genes from the host's chromosome. A virus could feasibly acquire an activated oncogene when excising from its host, and this gene could be transferred to a new host.",

Some cell types have a few of these organelles, and other cell types have hundreds of mitochondria. An interesting feature of mitochondria that distinguishes them from other organelles is that they have their own DNA, termed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The mtDNA is completely distinct from the nuclear chromosomes and is presumed to have evolved separately from the nuclear DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is circular and consists of 37 genes coding for proteins, transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Each mitochondrion has about five copies of the mtDNA. All of the mitochondria within the body's cells are descendants of the mitochondria present in an egg cell before it was fertilized. Because all mitochondria are derived from those present in an egg cell, they contain the mtDNA from the mother. Sperm contribute no mitochondria or mtDNA to the egg cell during fertilization. This mode of inheritance is often called maternal inheritance.\n\nAlthough mtDNA composes a small portion of the cell's total DNA, it is subject to mutation, and several diseases are known to be caused by mutations to mtDNA. One of those diseases is Leber's optic atrophy, which causes deterioration of the optic nerve and a progressive loss of central vision. Most people with this condition have inherited both normal mtDNA and mtDNA that carries the mutation. When mutated mitochondria outnumber normal mitochondria, symptoms of the disease occur.\n12.

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 1-6 are based on the following passage.\n\nPassage I\n\nAccording to Professor John MacKinnon, certain places are more likely than others to house new or rediscovered species. First, scientists should look in areas that are geologically stable. Areas with regular earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are less likely to contain species that go back thousands of years because, obviously, the frequent upheavals are not conducive to steady growth or a comfortable way of life. Second, scientists are most likely to find undiscovered or rediscovered species in remote, isolated areas. Cultivated areas are inhospitable to many animals. Often, cultivation eliminates the trees or shrubs that house and protect animal life. A stable climate is a third thing to look for. Stability of climate ensures that the animals that live in the region have had no reason to leave for warmer or wetter environments.\n\nAlthough most of the recent discoveries and rediscoveries of animal species have taken place in tropical, humid regions, some have occurred in rarely explored mountain habitats. A fourth key thing scientists should look for, according to MacKinnon, is an area with a variety of unusual species that are specific to that area. Of course, this requirement refers back to requirement number two, isolation. An area that is very isolated or difficult to access will naturally have species that cannot be found anywhere else.\n\nIn 1994 American biologist Peter Zahler took his second trip to the isolated valleys of the Diamer region in northern Pakistan. He was searching for the woolly flying squirrel, a dog-sized squirrel last seen in 1924. As he describes it, he had narrowed down his search to two animals, using the criteria mammal, not too small, relatively unknown, and in need of conservation intervention. Because he did not wish to spend time in the steamy environment of the Congo basin, he eliminated the aquatic genet \nthe squirrel. Many recalled hearing tales about the strange animal, but all insisted it was extinct.\n\nZahler continued to set traps, listen to squirrel legends, and ask questions. He dodged avalanches, skirted valleys patrolled by armed warlords, and crossed mountains on narrow goat paths. Policemen told him that the squirrels indeed existed in caves above the valley, and that they excreted a substance, salajit, that was used as an aphrodisiac. One day, two large, machine gun-toting men entered his camp. After some small talk, one asked whether he would be willing to pay for a live squirrel. The pair claimed to be salajit collectors. Zahler agreed to pay top dollar, never envisioning that 2 hours later, he would be presented with a woolly flying squirrel in a bag. Following that surprise, Zahler located evidence of live squirrels throughout the region. The squirrel certainly obeyed all of MacKinnon's regulations. Despite frequent avalanches, the Himalayas are a geologically stable area with a harsh but stable climate and a number of rare species. Not only were the squirrels' caves remote and isolated, it was often necessary to rappel down or climb up sheer cliffs to reach them.\n\nEach rediscovery gives scientists a vital second chance to protect and preserve our rarest, most fragile species. With scientists and students from Pakistan, Zahler began work on a program to protect the squirrel's habitat. Only the advent of war in Afghanistan forced him to abandon the area, and he remains connected to scientists in Pakistan who are continuing the effort.\n1. According to the passage, all of these are true EXCEPT:\n\nA. Woolly flying squirrels excrete an unusual substance.\n\nB. The Himalayas contain a variety of unique species.\n\nC. Animals in a drought may leave for a wetter habitat.\n\nD. The woolly flying squirrel vanished for 70 years.",

First, scientists should look in areas that are geologically stable. Areas with regular earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are less likely to contain species that go back thousands of years because, obviously, the frequent upheavals are not conducive to steady growth or a comfortable way of life. Second, scientists are most likely to find undiscovered or rediscovered species in remote, isolated areas. Cultivated areas are inhospitable to many animals. Often, cultivation eliminates the trees or shrubs that house and protect animal life. A stable climate is a third thing to look for. Stability of climate ensures that the animals that live in the region have had no reason to leave for warmer or wetter environments.\n\nAlthough most of the recent discoveries and rediscoveries of animal species have taken place in tropical, humid regions, some have occurred in rarely explored mountain habitats. A fourth key thing scientists should look for, according to MacKinnon, is an area with a variety of unusual species that are specific to that area. Of course, this requirement refers back to requirement number two, isolation. An area that is very isolated or difficult to access will naturally have species that cannot be found anywhere else.\n\nIn 1994 American biologist Peter Zahler took his second trip to the isolated valleys of the Diamer region in northern Pakistan. He was searching for the woolly flying squirrel, a dog-sized squirrel last seen in 1924. As he describes it, he had narrowed down his search to two animals, using the criteria mammal, not too small, relatively unknown, and in need of conservation intervention. Because he did not wish to spend time in the steamy environment of the Congo basin, he eliminated the aquatic genet \nthe squirrel. Many recalled hearing tales about the strange animal, but all insisted it was extinct.\n\nZahler continued to set traps, listen to squirrel legends, and ask questions. He dodged avalanches, skirted valleys patrolled by armed warlords, and crossed mountains on narrow goat paths. Policemen told him that the squirrels indeed existed in caves above the valley, and that they excreted a substance, salajit, that was used as an aphrodisiac. One day, two large, machine gun-toting men entered his camp. After some small talk, one asked whether he would be willing to pay for a live squirrel. The pair claimed to be salajit collectors. Zahler agreed to pay top dollar, never envisioning that 2 hours later, he would be presented with a woolly flying squirrel in a bag. Following that surprise, Zahler located evidence of live squirrels throughout the region. The squirrel certainly obeyed all of MacKinnon's regulations. Despite frequent avalanches, the Himalayas are a geologically stable area with a harsh but stable climate and a number of rare species. Not only were the squirrels' caves remote and isolated, it was often necessary to rappel down or climb up sheer cliffs to reach them.\n\nEach rediscovery gives scientists a vital second chance to protect and preserve our rarest, most fragile species. With scientists and students from Pakistan, Zahler began work on a program to protect the squirrel's habitat. Only the advent of war in Afghanistan forced him to abandon the area, and he remains connected to scientists in Pakistan who are continuing the effort.\n2.

Of the three, the main form that is mined is gibbsite. Bauxite may be hard or soft, and it comes in a variety of colors that range from white to red.\n\nBauxite is formed due to the weathering of alumina-bearing rocks. It often appears as an extensive blanket of ore and is usually mined using surface-mining techniques. By far the largest consumers of aluminum are the United States, Japan, and Germany, but except for a little in Texas and Arkansas, bauxite is nearly nonexistent there. The major producers of bauxite are Australia, which produces around 40 percent of the SECTION 4:\n\nCritical\n\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT\n\nworld's supply, and Guinea, in West Africa. The United States gets much of its supply from Brazil and Jamaica.\n\nThe extraction of aluminum from bauxite requires three stages. First, the ore is mined. Then it is refined to recover alumina.

The solution is separated from the silicate through washing and pumping, and the alumina is precipitated from the solution, where it appears as crystals of alumina hydrate. The crystals are washed again to remove any remaining solution. Then they are heated to remove water, leaving the gritty alumina.\n\nSmelting is done via the Hall-Heroult smelting process. An electric current is passed through a molten solution of alumina and cryolite, which is in a cell lined at the bottom and top with carbon.

Along with the usual mining issues of degraded soil and polluted runoff, chief among them is the omnipresent bauxite dust, which clogs machinery and lungs, sometimes for miles around the mining site.

Of the three, the main form that is mined is gibbsite. Bauxite may be hard or soft, and it comes in a variety of colors that range from white to red.\n\nBauxite is formed due to the weathering of alumina-bearing rocks. It often appears as an extensive blanket of ore and is usually mined using surface-mining techniques. By far the largest consumers of aluminum are the United States, Japan, and Germany, but except for a little in Texas and Arkansas, bauxite is nearly nonexistent there. The major producers of bauxite are Australia, which produces around 40 percent of the SECTION 4:\n\nCritical\n\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT\n\nworld's supply, and Guinea, in West Africa.

Ground bauxite is fed into a digester, where it is mixed with a caustic soda. The aluminum oxide reacts with the soda to form a solution of sodium aluminate and a precipitate of sodium aluminum silicate. The solution is separated from the silicate through washing and pumping, and the alumina is precipitated from the solution, where it appears as crystals of alumina hydrate. The crystals are washed again to remove any remaining solution. Then they are heated to remove water, leaving the gritty alumina.\n\nSmelting is done via the Hall-Heroult smelting process. An electric current is passed through a molten solution of alumina and cryolite, which is in a cell lined at the bottom and top with carbon. This forces the oxygen to combine with the carbon at the top of the cell, making carbon dioxide, while the molten metallic aluminum collects at the bottom of the cell, where it is siphoned off, cleaned up, and cast into bars, sheets, or whatever form is needed.\n\nAs with all mining of metals, bauxite mining presents certain hazards. Along with the usual mining issues of degraded soil and polluted runoff, chief among them is the omnipresent bauxite dust, which clogs machinery and lungs, sometimes for miles around the mining site. Jamaica and Brazil have seen widespread protests recently against the major bauxite mining companies, which continue to insist that no link between bauxite dust and pervasive lung problems has been proved.\n17.

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 19-25 are based on the following passage.\n\nPassage IV\n\n\"I acknowledge Shakespeare to be the world's greatest dramatic poet, but regret that no parent could place the uncorrected book in the hands of his daughter, and therefore I have prepared the Family Shakespeare.\"\n\nThus did Thomas Bowdler, a self-appointed editor trained as a physician, explain his creation of a children's edition of Shakespeare that omitted some characters completely, toned down language he considered objectionable, and euphemized such shocking situations as Ophelia's suicide-an accident in Bowdler's version.\n\nBowdler was hardly the first to tone down the Bard. Poet laureate Nahum Tate rewrote King Lear, banishing the Fool entirely and giving the play a happy ending. His version was staged regularly from the 1680 s through the 18 th century.\n\nThomas Bowdler was, from all the evidence, a less likely editor. He was born in 1754 near Bath, England, to a wealthy family. He studied medicine but never really practiced, preferring to exercise philanthropy and to play chess, at which he was a master. In his retirement, he decided to try his hand at editorial work. Shakespeare's dramas were his first project. He added nothing to the texts, but by cutting and paraphrasing strove to remove anything that \"could give just offense to the religious and virtuous mind.\"\n\nThe result was a 10-volume expurgated version that was criticized widely, although hardly universally. The famed British poet Algernon Swinburne remarked that \"no man ever did better service to Shakespeare than the man who made it possible to put him into the hands of intelligent and imaginative children.\"\n\nThere is some indication that Bowdler's sister Harriet did the actual editing of Shakespeare's text. She was a poet and editor in her own right, and clearly more qualified than her brother to lay hands on the Bard of Avon. She may have published the expurgated edition anonymously before allowing her brother to take over the rights. If SECTION 4:\n\nCritical\n\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT\n\nthis is so, it is unsurprising that Harriet would not have wanted her name on the book. If the original Shakespeare were truly objectionable, then it would have been doubly so for a well-bred, unmarried Englishwoman of the day.\n\nBowdler went on to create children's versions of the Old Testament and of Edward Gibbons's History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, although neither achieved either the success or ridicule of his Shakespeare. Today, of course, we know Bowdler not for his good works, but instead for the eponym derived from his good name. To bowdlerize is to censor or amend a written work, often with a connotation of prudishness. The process for which Bowdler is known is one that continues to the present day, as texts deemed too difficult for today's high schoolers are \"dumbed-down,\" library editions of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn have the \"n-word\" blacked out, and middle-school productions of popular Broadway plays have all expletives deleted. We would be hard-pressed to say that we live in a prudish era, but some of the same impulses that drove Thomas and Harriet Bowdler still exist today.\n25. Given the information in the passage, if a bowdlerized version of Shakespeare were available to parents today, which of the following outcomes would MOST likely occur?\nA. Some would ridicule it, and others would buy it.\nB. No one would take it or its author seriously.\nC. Most students would find it too difficult to read.\nD. It would be a dismal failure and be taken off the market.",

Surprisingly, a loud and ongoing controversy surrounds a choice that at first look seems most benign-that of the Guatemalan freedom fighter, Rigoberta Mench\u00fa Tum.\n\nRigoberta Mench\u00fa was born in 1959 to a poor Mayan family in Guatemala. At the time of her birth, General Yd\u00edgoras Fuentes had just seized power, following the assassination of Colonel Castillo Armas.

At the same time, right-wing vigilantes led a campaign of torture and assassination, eliminating students and peasants they deemed to be allied with the guerillas.\n\nIn the countryside where Rigoberta lived, the battles were largely over control of farmland. Rigoberta's father was taken into custody and tortured when the army believed he had assisted in the assassination of a plantation owner. Following a rout of the guerillas by the army, the guerillas regrouped and began to take their fight to the capital, beginning a long series of assassinations of government figures.\n\nRigoberta, her father, and some of her siblings joined the Committee of the Peasant Union (CUC).

The Red Cross, yes, but Henry Kissinger? Mother Teresa, perhaps, but Yasser Arafat? Surprisingly, a loud and ongoing controversy surrounds a choice that at first look seems most benign-that of the Guatemalan freedom fighter, Rigoberta Mench\u00fa Tum.\n\nRigoberta Mench\u00fa was born in 1959 to a poor Mayan family in Guatemala. At the time of her birth, General Yd\u00edgoras Fuentes had just seized power, following the assassination of Colonel Castillo Armas. The year she turned one, there was a failed coup by a military group, many of whom fled to the countryside and would return to lead the rebellion that would wax and wane for the next 36 years.\n\nGuatemala was divided into factions for that entire period, as military governments controlled the nation and guerilla groups controlled the countryside. At the same time, right-wing vigilantes led a campaign of torture and assassination, eliminating students and peasants they deemed to be allied with the guerillas.\n\nIn the countryside where Rigoberta lived, the battles were largely over control of farmland. Rigoberta's father was taken into custody and tortured when the army believed he had assisted in the assassination of a plantation owner. Following a rout of the guerillas by the army, the guerillas regrouped and began to take their fight to the capital, beginning a long series of assassinations of government figures.\n\nRigoberta, her father, and some of her siblings joined the Committee of the Peasant Union (CUC). In rapid succession, Rigoberta lost her brother, father, and mother to the army's own assassination squads. Rigoberta, though only in her early 20s, became a key figure in the resistance, traveling from village to village to educate the Mayan peasants in overcoming oppression, and leading demonstrations in Guatemala City.\n\nSoon Rigoberta was herself a target. She fled to Mexico and continued her life as an organizer, concentrating her focus on peasants' rights. She participated in the founding of the United Representation of the Guatemalan Opposition (RUOG). This period was the most violent of the entire Guatemalan civil war. Under the new president, General Efrain R\u00edos Montt, massacres of civilians became an everyday occurrence. SECTION 4:\n\nCritical\n\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills The controversy is all about the book. It began when anthropologist David Stoll began independent research on the same era about which Rigoberta dictated and discovered discrepancies in her recall of events. Massacres she described were not remembered by the locals; one of her brothers died by shooting rather than by fire, dates were incorrect, and so on. Stoll's discoveries were enough to roil up conservative historians and columnists, who declared Rigoberta's book the grossest propaganda and her career, therefore, unworthy of the Nobel Prize. Not surprisingly, this brought forth charges of racism, sexism, and cultural ignorance from the other side.\n\nThe Nobel Committee maintained a stiff upper lip throughout the political backand-forth and still insists that Rigoberta's prize had to do with her documented good works and not with her personal recorded history. Rigoberta's book is still widely taught, and her place in the history of Central American peasant revolutions seems assured.\n32. If David Stoll is to be believed, Rigoberta's autobiography seems to be an example of:\n\nA. \"truthiness,\" the quality of preferring facts one wishes were true to those that are true\n\nB. \"epic,\" a narrative unified by a legendary hero who reflects the aspirations of a nation or race\n\nC. \"folktale,\" a story of cumulative authorship from the oral tradition\n\nD. \"manifesto,\" a credo or position paper in which the leader of a political movement sets forth tenets and beliefs",

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 34-40 are based on the following passage.\n\n\\section{Passage VI}\n\nIf our knowledge of the world occurs through the weaving of narratives, as postmodernists would have us believe, then we must judge the truth of each narrative by comparing it with what we value and what we already accept as true. Any metanarrative, or overarching \"big story,\" must be rejected because it attempts to explain away too many individual narratives. \nhistory through that metanarrative, postmodernists would argue, does not allow us to consider the contributions of other groups to the country we live in today. So constructing a metanarrative can often be exclusionary.\n\nOf course, constructing a series of smaller narratives is just as exclusionary because it frames experience in a limited way. It is easy to see this occurring if you look at any university course list today. How is it possible for American History 4111, \"Imperialism and Amerindians, 1600-1840\" to coexist alongside American History 4546, \"American Military History and Policy\"? Does English 340X, \"Survey of Women's Literature,\" subsume or incorporate elements of English 342X, \"American Indian Women Writers\"? Perhaps we should pity the undergraduate student today. Lacking any overarching metanarrative to provide perspective, how can the poor student wade through the often contradictory mininarratives being thrown his or her way?\n\nThere is no question that the old way was wrongheaded and elitist. Survey courses that emphasized the white male perspective were removed from the curriculum in the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, and for good reason. But replacing them with a smorgasbord of mininarratives risks eliminating any sense of a big picture. Can students connect the dots to define a coherent reality, or must their reality be a series of frames with no links among them?\n\nRevising the canon was about ridding our perspective of those racist, sexist, or classist notions that insisted on a single Truth with a capital $T$. Of course there is no overriding Truth that applies to everyone. For everyone who believes that Thomas Jefferson was a brilliant reformer, there is someone who thinks he was a two-faced slaveholder. Yet, where does it leave us if everyone we know is approaching history, science, literature, or what have you from a slightly different angle? It's bad enough when partisan politics divides us into red states and blue states. How much worse is it to imagine ourselves clad in thousands upon thousands of shades of purple?\n\nThe clearest sign that we are not ready to abandon our metanarratives comes in the current and ongoing clash between those who accept evolutionary theory and those who accept the Bible as the written word of God. The latter grant the Earth 6000 years of life, the former give it several million more, and never the twain shall meet. Each of these viewpoints is a metanarrative, a big story that governs people's understanding of the world. Like many metanarratives, each of these completely negates the other.\n\nSo on the one hand, metanarratives don't work well because they are too exclusionary. And on the other hand, mininarratives don't work well because they are too narrow. It will be fascinating to watch the canon evolve over the next few decades and to see whether this dichotomy can ever be resolved.\n40. A comparison of a mininarrative to a metanarrative would be MOST similar to a comparison of:\nA. a cropped photograph to a wide-angle photograph\nB. a globe to a world map\nC. a ranch-style house to a palace\nD. a single domestic turkey to a flock of wild turkeys",

Print newspapers and magazines have a staff of writers, researchers, and editors who find what they deem to be appropriate (often defined as \"nonoffense\") material, shape it, and present it to an audience of passive consumers.

The author indicates that millions of people are blogging but does not mention how many people read popular blogs. Therefore choice A is not supported by the text and can be eliminated. Similarly, the author notes that advertisers are spending more money on blogs than they have in the past but does not reveal that traditional print and broadcasting outlets are receiving less money (choice B).

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 1-6 are based on the following passage.\n\nPassage I\n\nSea beans. Ballast waifs. These adorable nicknames do not hint at the destructive nature of invasive plants. Sea beans are those plants whose seeds, buoyed by a pocket of air, float on the tide from one island to another, or even across vast stretches of ocean. Ballast waifs are less natural in origin; they are seeds that arrive on one shore from another in the soil placed in a ship's hold as ballast.\n\nOne remarkably lovely and dreadfully damaging ballast waif is Lythrum salicaria, the bright purple, spiky flower known commonly as purple loosestrife. Purple loosestrife is not a newcomer to U.S. shores; it arrived from Eurasia, almost certainly via ship, some 200 years ago. It was widely used for medicinal and ornamental purposes throughout the 19th century. Its lovely purple blooms may still be seen in gardens throughout the country, where people love it for its long growing season.\n\nFor all its beauty, purple loosestrife is a menace. The same long growing season that makes it so beloved by gardeners makes it a seed-making machine. A mature plant may produce 2 or 3 million seeds a year.\n\nThat is not enough for Lythrum salicaria, however. It also propagates underground, sending out shoots and stems in all directions. It is also able to cross-pollinate with other species of Lythrum.\n\nScientists took little notice of purple loosestrife until sometime in the 1930s, when a particular strain began colonizing along the St. Lawrence River, an area rife with the sort of wetlands purple loosestrife likes best. Purple loosestrife does not just propagate wildly; it also adapts easily to changes in environment. As it starts up in a new area, it quickly outcompetes native grasses, sedges, and other flowering plants, forming dense MCAT\n\nstands of purple loosestrife where once heterogeneous wetland meadows existed. This not only eradicates the native plants, but it also removes food sources for migratory birds and other animals.\n\nIn recent years, purple loosestrife has had a devastating impact on native cattails and wild rice. It has invaded and destroyed spawning areas for fish. In rural areas, it is beginning to move away from wetlands and adapt to drier areas, encroaching on agricultural lands. In urban areas, it is blocking pipes and drainage canals. It has moved steadily westward and is now found in all states but Florida.\n\nAttempts to control purple loosestrife have been only partially successful. It has proved resistant to many herbicides, and it is impervious to burning, as its rootstock lies beneath the surface and can reproduce from there. It can be mowed down and plowed under, and then replaced with a less invasive plant. This is very labor-intensive in marshy areas that are substantially overgrown, but it may be the only way of eliminating the pest. Plowing it under requires unusually large discs on the plow because it is important to chop up the rootstock. Gardeners who have planted purple loosestrife are encouraged to dig it up and replace it with other, less damaging plants.\n\nThe best plan may be to seek a natural enemy of purple loosestrife, a weevil or insect that will destroy the plant. However, finding such an enemy that will target only purple loosestrife while leaving other, preferred plants intact is a daunting task. More important than that, introducing yet another foreign species to American swampland may lead to problems that make our purple loosestrife infestation look mild.\n1. According to the passage, all of these are true EXCEPT:\n\nA. Purple loosestrife propagates through an underground system.\n\nB. Purple loosestrife has even affected the survival of fish.\n\nC. Purple loosestrife is best eradicated through controlled burning.\n\nD. Purple loosestrife is often used in American gardens.",

It can be mowed down and plowed under, and then replaced with a less invasive plant. This is very labor-intensive in marshy areas that are substantially overgrown, but it may be the only way of eliminating the pest. Plowing it under requires unusually large discs on the plow because it is important to chop up the rootstock. Gardeners who have planted purple loosestrife are encouraged to dig it up and replace it with other, less damaging plants.\n\nThe best plan may be to seek a natural enemy of purple loosestrife, a weevil or insect that will destroy the plant.

Like many wars of the 19th century, it was declared not by Parliament but rather by people on the scene. Sir Henry Bartle Frere was an emissary of the Queen, sent to Cape Town to find a way to unify the British and Boer colonies with a variety of independent black states to form a Confederation of South Africa. Standing in his way was the Zulu Army, a robust contingent of 40,000 warriors under the leadership of King Cetshwayo.\n\nFrere looked for a way to seize Zululand. He used a series of minor border disputes to prompt an ultimatum to Cetshwayo, demanding that his army disband and be remodeled within 30 days. Cetshwayo refused to reply, which led to a state of war. A month and a half later, a British force invaded Zululand. They moved in three columns toward the royal compound.\n\nOn the 22nd of January, the middle column, led by Lord Chelmsford, a favorite of the Queen, split, with Chelmsford leading a large force to support a small reconnoitering party. The 1,750 left at camp soon found themselves surrounded by nearly 20,000 Zulus. Notice was sent to Chelmsford, but he would not be deflected from his plan. The resulting massacre at Isandhlwana reduced the middle column by 1,350 men. Some SECTION 4:\n\nCritical\n\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT\n\nof the survivors retreated to Rorke's Drift, where they joined a small force of about 100 men who had successfully held off a few thousand warriors.\n\nNews of the massacre made its way to England, but Chelmsford, quite the modern military man, had already put a cover-up in place. He managed to convince the Queen and some of the press that Isandhlwana was overcome due to a lack of ammunition, and he put forth Rorke's Drift as a major victory, allowing that minor skirmish to be glorified as the massacre was all but forgotten. He would later blame Isandhlwana on the disobedience of an officer who died there.\n\nChelmsford's self-supporting propaganda was effective for a while, but as the Zulu War turned even bloodier, albeit more successful for the British, he was eventually recalled and replaced by Field Marshal Wolseley. Wolseley would command the British troops through the final campaigns of the Zulu War, campaigns that culminated in the capture of King Cetshwayo. The British divided up Cetshwayo's kingdom into 13 minichiefdoms, granting 11 to Zulus, 1 to a pro-British Basuto chief, and 1 to a white African mercenary. This plan led to many years of civil war, and in 1882, the British restored Cetshwayo to his throne, leaving his son in charge of a nearby territory. In 1883 that son joined with a band of Boer mercenaries and invaded his father's kraal, forcing his father into exile, where he soon died under mysterious circumstances. In league with the Boer who would become the first prime minister of South Africa, Louis Botha, a second son of Cetshwayo's attacked his brother and defeated his army.

Chelmsford's cover-up (I) had nothing to do with the Africans. The three-column advance (II) may have been a tactical error, but it cannot be blamed on a failure to understand Africans. The failure of partition (III), however, indicates that the British did not recognize the divisions among tribal leaders and peoples. Since only III is a yes, the answer is choice C.",

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 13-18 are based on the following passage.\n\nPassage III\n\nIn the history of preemptive wars that end badly, we must consider the Zulu War of 1879. Like many wars of the 19th century, it was declared not by Parliament but rather by people on the scene. Sir Henry Bartle Frere was an emissary of the Queen, sent to Cape Town to find a way to unify the British and Boer colonies with a variety of independent black states to form a Confederation of South Africa. Standing in his way was the Zulu Army, a robust contingent of 40,000 warriors under the leadership of King Cetshwayo.\n\nFrere looked for a way to seize Zululand. He used a series of minor border disputes to prompt an ultimatum to Cetshwayo, demanding that his army disband and be remodeled within 30 days. Cetshwayo refused to reply, which led to a state of war. A month and a half later, a British force invaded Zululand. They moved in three columns toward the royal compound.\n\nOn the 22nd of January, the middle column, led by Lord Chelmsford, a favorite of the Queen, split, with Chelmsford leading a large force to support a small reconnoitering party. The 1,750 left at camp soon found themselves surrounded by nearly 20,000 Zulus. Notice was sent to Chelmsford, but he would not be deflected from his plan. The resulting massacre at Isandhlwana reduced the middle column by 1,350 men. Some SECTION 4:\n\nCritical\n\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT\n\nof the survivors retreated to Rorke's Drift, where they joined a small force of about 100 men who had successfully held off a few thousand warriors.\n\nNews of the massacre made its way to England, but Chelmsford, quite the modern military man, had already put a cover-up in place. He managed to convince the Queen and some of the press that Isandhlwana was overcome due to a lack of ammunition, and he put forth Rorke's Drift as a major victory, allowing that minor skirmish to be glorified as the massacre was all but forgotten. He would later blame Isandhlwana on the disobedience of an officer who died there.\n\nChelmsford's self-supporting propaganda was effective for a while, but as the Zulu War turned even bloodier, albeit more successful for the British, he was eventually recalled and replaced by Field Marshal Wolseley. Wolseley would command the British troops through the final campaigns of the Zulu War, campaigns that culminated in the capture of King Cetshwayo. The British divided up Cetshwayo's kingdom into 13 minichiefdoms, granting 11 to Zulus, 1 to a pro-British Basuto chief, and 1 to a white African mercenary. This plan led to many years of civil war, and in 1882, the British restored Cetshwayo to his throne, leaving his son in charge of a nearby territory. In 1883 that son joined with a band of Boer mercenaries and invaded his father's kraal, forcing his father into exile, where he soon died under mysterious circumstances. In league with the Boer who would become the first prime minister of South Africa, Louis Botha, a second son of Cetshwayo's attacked his brother and defeated his army. This son, Dinizulu, would be the last king of the Zulus to have any power. His land is now part of KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa.\n18. The author's description of the Zulu War makes it seem MOST similar to:\nA. the peasant uprising known as Kett's Rebellion\nB. the systematic genocide of the Nigeria-Biafra conflict\nC. the amphibious raid by the Allies on Dieppe, Normandy\nD. the removal by force of Saddam Hussein in Iraq",

By the time of the Civil War, hunting and habitat destruction had caused their extinction in most eastern states. All of the eastern subspecies are now extinct. Elk County, Pennsylvania, and Elk County, Kansas, were without elk for more than a century.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, herds of elk in the Rocky Mountains faced death by starvation as encroaching farms depleted their winter feeding and finally the government decided to intercede.

The elk were released from cattle cars and chased into the wild to fend for themselves. Two years later, 95 more elk were moved from Yellowstone to Pennsylvania.\n\nElk are large animals with large ranges, and the damage these elk caused to cornfields was substantial.

No real census was taken until 50 years later, in 1971. SECTION 4:\n\nCritical\n\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills \nby the early 1980s. By the year 2000, there were more than 500 elk in Pennsylvania, including many in Elk County.\n\nIn 1984 a group of hunters established the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, whose mission is to reintroduce elk in the states where they once roamed. The foundation runs into resistance from farmers and antihunting groups and generally requires majority approval from the community before animals are introduced. At present, new herds are established in Arkansas, Kentucky, Michigan, and Wisconsin in addition to Pennsylvania. There is talk of moving herds to Tennessee and to the Adirondack range in New York. It seems fairly clear that improving habitat for elk reintroduction improves conditions for other wildlife-wild turkey, whitetail deer, and black bear, among others.\n\nUnlike the way things were done in the 1910s, today reintroduction is far more closely monitored and controlled. Animals are tested for disease. They are held in a large enclosure until they have acclimated to their surroundings. After a few weeks, they are released, but most have radio collars and/or ear tags that allow researchers to track their movements and habitat use. Research results help foresters know what to plant where in order to keep the herd healthy and help biologists know whether the herd is thriving or is in need of intercession. Land trusts are used to preserve habitat and to keep the elk from moving too close to cropland. The people in charge of elk reintroduction have no desire to live through another annihilation of the eastern wapiti.\n25. Which new information, if true, would most CHALLENGE the claim that elk reintroduction benefits other species as well?\nA. record sightings of wild turkey, pheasant, and grouse on reclaimed land in Pennsylvania\nB. surprising numbers of multiple births in moose from central and western Maine and New Hampshire\nC. a census showing that whitetail deer were migrating northward from Pennsylvania into New York\nD. an increase in temperature of one or two degrees in the headwaters of the Yellowstone River",

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 26-33 are based on the following passage.\n\n\\section{Passage $\\mathrm{V}$}\n\nIn linguistics, metathesis refers to the reversal of phonemes in a word. This can come about by accident, as in the common mispronunciation \"aks\" for ask or the common (and correct) pronunciation of iron as \"i-orn.\" It may come about on purpose, as in various language games.\n\nAccidental metathesis may be a process that takes place in the evolution of languages. Over time, for example, the Latin words miraculum, periculum, and parabola evolved into the Spanish words milagro, peligro, and palabra. Linguists posit that such SECTION 4:\n\nCritical\n\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT\n\nchanges usually occur when two consonants are of the same type, with similar mouth formations needed to create each one.\n\nThe Reverend Archibald Spooner, an Oxford dean, was known for his unintentional transpositions and gave his name to the particular metathesis he represented: Spoonerisms. Most famous Spoonerisms once attributed to Spooner are now believed to be apocryphal, but they are nevertheless amusing; for example, his supposed advice to a substandard student: \"You have deliberately tasted two worms and will leave Oxford by the next town drain.\" Spoonerisms are funny when the metathesis involved changes one word into another, and they seem to lend themselves particularly well to off-color jokes.\n\nEveryone is familiar with Pig Latin, in which initial consonant sounds are moved to the end of a word and followed with the syllable \"ay.\" This is not pure metathesis, but it begins with the kind of metathesis known as backslang, in which syllables or letters in a word are reversed to produce a private code. Pig Latin may have begun as a language spoken in prisoner-of-war camps; it was certainly used in such camps during World War II and in Vietnam.\n\nIn Pig Latin, the phrase \"Over the river and through the woods\" becomes \"Overay uhthay iverray anday oughthray uhthay oodsway.\" In other variations of Pig Latin, it might instead be \"Overway uhthay iverray andway oughthray uhthay oodsway.\" There are computer programs that translate from English to Pig Latin and back again, and there is even a version of the Bible written entirely in Pig Latin. For the most part, however, outside of prisoner-of-war camps, Pig Latin is a funny code used by children.\n\nFrench children and teenagers use a similar code. Called verlan (a reversal of l'envers, or \"reversal\"), it is trickier than Pig Latin because it relies much more on phonetics than on spelling. In verlan, the word caf\u00e9 becomes f\u00e9ca, but the word tomber (\"to fall\") becomes b\u00e9ton. Verlan becomes even more complex in words that end in silent $e$ or which have only one syllable. While just a few words from Pig Latin have entered the vernacular (for example, amscray and ixnay), many verlan words are common lingo in France.\n\nHistorically, for reasons that are not quite clear, butchers have been frequent users of metathesis, creating their own backslang to converse without being understood by patrons.

That name, of course, represents the ultimate in metathesis-the reversal of letters instead of merely syllables.\n33.

Atomistic thinkers, such as Descartes and Wittgenstein, believe that the whole is no more than the sum of its parts. A thorough study of these parts, atomists believe, will lead to an understanding of the whole. A contrasting view, held by Schelling, Hegel (although some scholars question whether Hegel's ontology actually conforms to this formalist conception of totality), and members of the structuralist school of philosophy, holds that the whole has an identity of its own, separate from the nature of its component parts. A third view, and perhaps the most challenging to explore, is the dialectical/materialist idea of the whole held by Karl Marx. In this view, the whole is seen not simply as the sum of its parts as atomists believe or as something independent of its parts according to formalist thought. Instead, the whole is conceived of as the constantly changing and evolving interactions between all of its component parts.\n\nIn Marx's view, there are no things\u2014static, independent objects or ideas-there are only processes. Everything that makes up the world is constantly in the process of becoming, with both its past and its future encapsulated in the very notion of the object itself. Furthermore, according to the dialectical materialist view, all objects are interdependent and the interactions they have with each other are also parts of their totalities.\n\nCritics of this perspective point out, somewhat justifiably, that such an ontology has a number of difficulties. One of their major objections is that dialectical materialism is impractical to employ in any meaningful way. Consider how thinking of even a simple object such as a chair in this way quickly leads to a surfeit of information, connections, and processes. For a chair is not simply a chair, but the result of the labor of an individual, a process of manufacturing, the needs of a society that requires chairs, and many other factors. And each of these factors has its own past (and future) and myriad other connections as well. The number of relationships increases exponentially, which quickly makes a dialectical worldview utterly overwhelming to even the most agile philosophical mind.\n\nMarxist philosophers attempt to work around this potential pathology by invoking what is called the process of abstraction. Abstraction allows the philosopher to draw certain boundaries around the object, idea, or relationship studied. Typically, these abstractions involve deciding an appropriate time scale to consider, the level of generality necessary for understanding specific interactions, and the vantage point from which to view a particular object of study. Abstraction on these levels allows the philosopher to bring certain relationships and processes into greater focus in order to understand them, while always keeping in mind that such an abstraction necessarily obscures various other connections. Marx famously used this process in his study of capitalism, sometimes viewing the system from the vantage point of the capitalist, other times assuming the perch of the worker, and even at times trying to view the system from the perspective of capital itself. Similarly, sometimes Marx generalized people as simply members of their class in order to gain a better grasp of the relationship between owner and worker. Each new abstraction adds to the understanding of the system, and the process of abstraction must happen again and again in order to bring hidden connections into view.\n34. The passage suggests that philosophical conceptions of totality:\nA. have evolved over time from an atomistic view to a dialectical view\nB. have prevented philosophers from grasping the inherent connections involved in all things\nC. are based on three mutually exclusive conceptions of the relationships between part and whole\nD. are limited to three competing and contrasting conceptions",

In fact, this area also determines personality, including emotional predispositions. Levels of activity on the right and left sides of the cerebral cortex relate to feelings of happiness and sadness. Specifically, higher levels of activity at the left frontal area of the cerebral cortex coincide with feelings of happiness, For example, meditation has been shown to generate left-brain activity, and studies show that it produces positive emotions. Davidson studied the link between meditation and happiness through a project involving Tibetan Buddhist monks. His research brings together Eastern and Western traditions, and it links together objective reality with internal states of consciousness once thought to be subjective. The connection is made through observable electrical activity in the central nervous system. When the monks in the study meditated, their brain activity was recorded.

During his lifetime, however, he was the most celebrated poet in the country. A closer look at the history of American poetry reveals that, despite his eminence, Longfellow wrote in a mold of both form and content that was already being challenged during his lifetime. But why, a century later, do the artistic works of many of his contemporaries continue to be enjoyed and studied while Longfellow languishes in the tomb of cultural artifacts?\n\nOne answer lies in the radical shift that began to take place in poetry in the mid19th century. Longfellow's themes and steadfast rhymes (and those of John Greenleaf Whittier, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowell) gave way gradually to confessional verse, whose subjects were more personal and rhymes were looser and less conventional. But to understand this shift, one must first understand the nature of Longfellow's work and his standing in the American literary scene of his time.\n\nLongfellow took as his subject his country's historical imagination, writing on an epic scale about Paul Revere, the Indian Hiawatha, and the pilgrim Miles Standish. He bestowed a mythic dimension on these figures, giving American readers iconic images that helped form a collective consciousness in the new country (indeed, Longfellow was a part of the first generation to be born in the United States). But Longfellow's content went beyond nationalistic pride-it was highly accessible and incredibly popular. Its accessibility is explained by his obvious themes that could be easily understood and embraced by the public. Longfellow did not challenge his readers, but appealed to their desire for stories that expounded an optimistic, sentimental, and moralistic worldview. Those themes were explored in rhyme that allowed readers to commit the poems to memory, much like songs. In 1857, The Song of Hiawatha, arguably his bestknown poem, sold 50,000 copies, an astounding number at the time. The next year, The Courtship of Miles Standish sold 25,000 copies in two months and in London sold 10,000 copies in one day. His success allowed him to give up a professorship at Harvard and focus full time on his writing.\n\nWalt Whitman, Longfellow's contemporary, wrote poetry similar to that of Longfellow-romantic and sentimental, with conventional rhyme and meter. But in the 1850s, indeed two years before The Song of Hiawatha, he wrote and published Leaves of Grass; a more radical departure from his previous work could not have been imagined. The 12 unnamed poems comprising Leaves of Grass are written in free verse-that is, without conventional rhyme and meter. Yet, like Longfellow, he was determined to explore the subject of America and his love for his country.\n\nWhitman looked to the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson for inspiration. Emerson wrote \"America is a poem in our eyes; its ample geography dazzles the imagination, and it will not wait long for metres.\" Indeed, Whitman paraphrased Emerson in his preface. Whitman's groundbreaking free verse changed the trajectory of American poetry. The next generation of poets, including Ezra Pound, Hart Crane, Sherwood Anderson, and William Carlos Williams, celebrated their debt to Whitman. Decades later, the influence of Whitman's work on Allen Ginsberg and Langston Hughes, among many others, continues his legacy.\n5. According to the passage, what might be the current reputation of poets such as Whittier and Holmes?\n\nA. They are considered integral writers in the history of American poetry.\n\nB.

But Longfellow's content went beyond nationalistic pride-it was highly accessible and incredibly popular. Its accessibility is explained by his obvious themes that could be easily understood and embraced by the public. Longfellow did not challenge his readers, but appealed to their desire for stories that expounded an optimistic, sentimental, and moralistic worldview. Those themes were explored in rhyme that allowed readers to commit the poems to memory, much like songs. In 1857, The Song of Hiawatha, arguably his bestknown poem, sold 50,000 copies, an astounding number at the time.

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 18-23 are based on the following passage.\n\nPassage IV\n\nIn literature, the period typically referred to as the 20th century actually begins in the previous century. To many, Queen Victoria's Jubilee in 1887 effectively marked the end of a literary epoch. The prevailing aesthetic sensibility, art for art's sake, was dying a slow death, as the gulf between artists and writers and the rest of the public widened, resulting in the widespread idea of the artist as one alienated from the rest of society. This viewpoint was spurred on by the bohemian culture movement, which arose in France and quickly spread. At its core, the bohemian movement scoffed at the limits placed on the individual by polite society and sought to isolate the artist from society as one who both rejects and is rejected by society.\n\nAcross the English Channel, developments in England further accentuated the separation of the artist from society at large. The Education Act of 1870 made elementary education mandatory, creating a massive class of literate, though still mostly uneducated, consumers. In response to this new market, new forms of entertainment were created, including the cheap and sensational \"yellow press,\" which focused on scandal, crime, and other base aspects of human nature.

The Bantu language of Kivunjo has roughly half a million combinations of prefixes and suffixes for a verb. English, however, has a mere four combinations. A verb such as to walk is limited to the following forms: walk, walks, walked, and walking.\n\nAlthough there are only four basic verb forms, the English language does have more than 13 possible inflections. It just makes do with these four forms for the various functions. English also differs significantly from many other Indo-European languages in that in English, the stem of the word can be pronounced and is in fact part of the language. In Spanish, the stem of the verb to walk is camin-, but this is not a word in the language. In order to pronounce this word, it must be conjugated and combined with a suffix. English uses the stem form of the verb for four inflections: the present tense (except for the third-person singular), the infinitive, the imperative, and the subjunctive. The verb form ending in $-s$ is used in only one case, the third-person singular.\n\nThe two possible verb suffixes, -ing and $-e d$, are put to use in a variety of ways as well.

Some thought the switch in loyalties was sour grapes, but others saw Alfred E. Smith as the epitome of William Wordsworth's \"happy warrior\" and therefore a man who \"makes his moral being his prime care\"-one who never made a move without consulting his conscience.\n\nAlfred E. Smith was both a successful politician and an unsuccessful one. A fourterm governor of New York State, he seemed a sure candidate for president, and indeed he ran three times for that position, only to lose each time.\n\nHe had several strikes against him. He was the Catholic son of Irish and ItalianGerman immigrants, making him anathema to nativists, the xenophobes who underwent a resurgence in the 1920s. He was from New York City, viewed even in the early twentieth century as disconnected from the national character. He was a progressive, which made conservatives of all stripes nervous. And he favored the repeal of Prohibition, a position that lost him the backing of many party leaders.\n\nWho was this unlikely candidate? Born Alfred Emanuel Smith in 1873, Smith grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. His father died when Smith was young, and the boy dropped out of school to take care of the family. At age 21, Smith supported a losing candidate in a local race and came to the attention of New York politicos, who took him under their wing. Nine years later, he ran successfully for the New York State Assembly, where he rapidly rose in the ranks to become Majority Leader and finally Speaker. He played a pivotal role in the revamping of New York's constitution, was elected sheriff of New York County, and then ran for governor in 1918, winning handily. Although he lost a re-election bid two years later, he surged back in 1922 and would remain in the governor's seat for six more years. His terms were marked by unparalleled improvements in labor laws and laws protecting civil liberties, for Smith's goal was to support those he saw as most in need of government's assistance.\n\nIn this goal, he was allied with Franklin Roosevelt, and the two were close enough that Roosevelt nominated Smith for president in 1924. The Drys, or Prohibitionists, backed William McAdoo, a son-in-law of former President Woodrow Wilson. Smith's supporters and McAdoo's supporters were so far apart that finally a compromise candidate, John Davis, was nominated and promptly lost the general election to Calvin Coolidge.\n\nIn 1928, Smith received his party's nomination on the second ballot, but along with his anti-Prohibition leanings, his religion became a major issue during the campaign, paving the way for Herbert Hoover to win the general election. Meanwhile, Smith had arranged for the nomination of his New York colleague, Franklin Roosevelt, to be governor of New York. Although Smith lost his bid, Roosevelt did not. Then came the Depression and the election of 1932. Backroom dealings ensured that Franklin Roosevelt won the nominating process, with another would-be presidential candidate in the vice-presidential spot on the ticket. Smith was left out in the cold on his third try for the presidency. Despite his former regard for Roosevelt, he began to work hard, if unsuccessfully, to defeat the New Deal. He supported two Republicans rather than Roosevelt in the 1936 and 1940 elections, and he died in 1944, a man who had never reached his desired goal, yet had inspired many of the changes for which his rival is now known.\n38. One important argument of the final paragraph is that:\nA. Roosevelt would have done better with Smith at his side.\nB. The New Deal was anathema to someone with Smith's ideals.\nC.

In contrast, today there are more than 40 megacities, most in less developed countries, and more urban centers are expected to explode in population by the year 2020. Demographers and globalization experts are already referring to the 21 st century as \"the urban century.\"\n\nAlready, more people on our Earth live in cities than live in rural areas. This is an enormous change in population trends, and it skews the entire planet in ways we haven't begun to analyze.\n\nAlthough some cities have seen immigration expand their borders, for most megacities, it is migration from within the country that has caused the city to grow. An example is China, where some 150 million rural inhabitants have migrated to cities in just the last 10 years. In many cases, the cities house the only possibilities of employment in this global economy. That is what has grown Mumbai (Bombay), India, from a large city to a megacity of more than 18 million people in just a few years. It's the cause of the explosion of populations in Lagos, Nigeria; Karachi, Pakistan; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Jakarta, Indonesia.\n\nWhereas just a few years ago, most large cities were in developed nations, now the largest are suddenly in the less developed countries of South America, Africa, and Asia. Imagine the pressure on the infrastructure of these already poor cities as the influx of workers pushes services to the breaking point. Slums and shantytowns spring up around the outskirts of the cities, and government is powerless to affect the disadvantaged workers, leaving them exposed to corrupt local officials or urban gangs. Imagine, too, what happens in the rural areas that these people have abandoned. China faces a desperate shortage of agricultural labor. So do other areas of Asia and Africa.\n\nAccording to United Nations (UN) statistics, by the year 2030, more than 60 percent of the world population will be urban, up from 30 percent in 1950 . Unlike the population growth in developed nations, the birth rate in less developed nations is high, meaning that the cities continue to grow even as migration slows from the rural areas. Megacities such as New York have populations that have leveled off over time. Despite its location in a less developed nation, even a megacity such as Mexico City has a slow rate of growth compared to Asian and African cities such as Mumbai or Lagos.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine what the growth of the megacities will mean to the world in the 21st century. Demographers foresee ecological overload, homelessness, uncontrolled traffic, and an infrastructure strained to the breaking point. Despite the notion that industrial jobs improve the lot of the workers, it is already possible to see that megacities are creating a new, even deeper division between rich and poor, as the poor concentrate in the outskirts of town and the rich barricade themselves behind walls and in towers.\n45. The main argument of the passage is that:\nA. Megacities are more often found in less developed nations but strain the resources of developed nations.\nB. The growth in population and number of megacities means foreseeable changes, many of them negative.\nC. The movement of population bases from rural to urban locations decimates the countryside and limits our ability to grow food.\nD.

Scientists are creating new strains of rice and wheat that require far less in the way of hands-on care.\nB. The number of people living below the poverty level will climb in less devel- oped and developed nations.\nC. Inflationary trends in heating oil and gasoline prices will limit most people's discretionary spending.\nD. New methods of birth control will limit the population explosion in the devel- oping world.",

        "Solution": "49. The correct answer is D. This incorporation of information question asks you to apply new evidence to an existing argument. This kind of question takes you furthest from the passage itself in an effort to get you to recognize its real-world applications. You might begin by scanning to locate the part of the passage that deals with the contention mentioned: that cities will continue to grow despite a slowing of migration from the countryside. It appears in paragraph 5 , and its causative link is the notion that \"the birth rate in less-developed nations is high.\" If you take away this cause, as choice D would do, then the author's supposition that cities will continue to grow has no foundation. None of the other answer choices would collapse the argument as well.",

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 50-53 are based on the following passage.\n\nPassage IX\n\nMuralism has long been a Mexican tradition, perhaps dating back to the Aztecs, who recorded their history on the walls of their pyramids. The covering of a white wall with political art made the careers of David Alfara Siqueiros, Jose Clemente Orozco, and the best known of them all, Diego Rivera.\n\nSiqueiros, born in Chihuahua, studied art from an early age. He organized a student strike at the age of 15 and later worked to unseat the Mexican dictator Huerta, attaining the rank of captain during the revolution that was taking place. He later brought his tactical knowledge to the world of organized labor, where his activism led to lengthy jail terms. That is where he created some of his finest artworks on canvas. During the 1930s, he went to Spain to join the anti-fascist forces. His life was that of a soldier-artist, and some considered him a dangerous, subversive gangster.\n\nOrozco, too, studied art as a youth and was inspired by the Mexican Revolution. One of his famous murals depicts the Holy Trinity as a worker, a soldier, and a peasant. Later he turned his focus to the dehumanizing effect of large cities on the people who live there. When he wasn't painting vast murals, Orozco was drawing political cartoons.\n\nRivera, the third of these Mexican Social Realists, los tres grandes, remains the most famous through sheer force of personality. His storytelling, his love affairs, his radicalism, and his love-hate relationship with the land of his birth informed his life and his paintings. He incorporated Mexican folklore and cultural icons into his murals in an effort to educate working people in their own history.\n\nIn the Chicano neighborhoods of the southwestern United States, political muralism still explodes onto bare walls in the form of graffiti. Edward Seymour's 1949 invention of canned spray paint provided would-be artists with an easy mode of expression, and the graffiti mural took off as an art form in the 1960s and 1970s. It began as outlaw art, which surely would have appealed to an outlaw such as Siqueiros. Despite the new artists' lack of formal training, some members of the outlaw group managed to create something beautiful while making political statements about poverty, injustice, diversity, and racism.\n\nOne extraordinary thing about this kind of public art is that it is truly for everyone. You do not need to enter the halls of a museum to see it; it resides on the walls of your local bodega or school or health clinic; you bounce your ball off of it in the basketball or handball court; you cover it over with posters for your favorite band or flyers about your lost pet.\n\nCertainly, many of the graffiti artists were reviled as nuisances, and their art was erased. For some, however, graffiti would prove a launching point into the world of fine art. Today, modern murals in Austin, San Antonio, Los Angeles, and Tucson, among others, attest to the power of the Mexican tradition of the muralist as purveyor of political thought.\n50.

Although the author refers to it as \"outlaw art\" and mentions that some people considered it a nuisance, that is clearly not the author's own impression. Phrases such as \"managed to create something beautiful while making political statements about poverty, injustice, diversity, and racism\" and \"public art ... that . . is truly for everyone\" put a positive spin on the topic. The author does not believe that graffiti is a \"pale imitation\" (choice B); instead, she indicates that the graffiti artists are following in the muralists' tradition.
